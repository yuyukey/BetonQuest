This makes it possible to write scripts that go far beyond what other quest plugins can do. This strength is amplified by a large number of integrations for other plugins. For many users, BetonQuest does not only power quests but also works as their servers' backbone that links all kinds of plugins together. Most competitors are \"just\" quest plugins and therefore limited to simple tasks. That's why BetonQuest skills are worth twice as much since you are not limited to writing quests! BetonQuest vs. Script Plugins \ud83d\udd17 While BetonQuest can be used for scripting, it stays a quest plugin. It's a compromise, the best of both worlds. Plugins with a full focus on scripting - such as Denizen and Skript are suited better in certain scenarios. Many users even use these alongside BetonQuest as there is integration for such scripting plugins. Features \ud83d\udd17 Example Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Beautiful multi-path Conversations \ud83d\udd17 Players can have immersive conversation with NPC's by utilizing BetonQuests Multi-Path-Conversation System. Questers can freely define multi-path stories, narrated with NPC conversations, and with multiple endings that affect a player's gameplay. Questers can also choose between five different styles to display their conversations. Endless Integrations \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest supports more then 30 other plugins, ranging from standard plugins like WorldGuard/WorldEdit and Citizens to more advanced ones such as EffectLib. It also offers support for other quest plugins, so you can just keep your old quests and create further additions to your quest lines based upon the progress in your old plugin. If just Beton isn't enough you can always just hook into Skript or Denizen too. See the full list of integrations here . Example Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Custom Notification System \ud83d\udd17 Questers can make use of BetonQuests notifyIO system that provides access to all of Minecafts GUI elements to display notifications. Provide NPC conversations in any language. Each player can set his own language which means that - if translated - all conversations will be in the players native language. You can give players information about where they are in a quest using the \"Journal\". The Journal is a book in which you can write content based on the players actions. Example Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Player, NPC and Hologram Hider \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest allows you to hide players from each other based on conditions. This can be used to create story-regions where players are always alone. It's also possible to hide entire Citizens NPC's and HolographicDisplays holograms. Training included \ud83d\udd17 This website provides in-depth learning material for your staff which teaches them all BetonQuest basics. It also has guides on related topics such as the setup of a local test server, so your main server's stability will not be threatened by staff learning / developing quests.

You need to create a class extending QuestEvent for each new event. The constructor must take one argument, an Instruction object. In the constructor you must extract all information from the instruction, for example skill names, locations etc. The description of the Instruction class is down below. Don't worry about checking event conditions, these are handled by the rest of BetonQuest's logic. Events are not bound to any player so firing it is done through fire(String playerID) method. You have to override it with your code responsible for doing stuff your event should do. Here you should use data previously parsed by the constructor. Don't access Instruction object here, it will lower the performance. You can convert playerID to Player object using the PlayerConverter class (it's a relict of times when both UUIDs and names could be used in Bukkit to identify players). If you want your event to be persistent , you need to set super.persistent variable to true in the constructor. This will make BetonQuest run this event even if the playerID points to an offline player, so prepare your code for that. If you want your event to be static , you need to set super.staticness variable to true in the constructor. This will allow BetonQuest to run this event with playerID set to null , so prepare your code for that. When you'll finish your class you need to invoke registerEvents(String name, Class<? extends QuestEvent> class) from BetonQuest instance (which you can get using BetonQuest.getInstance() static method). The name for your event will be used in instruction strings (such as \"journal\" for journal event). The class argument is the Class object of your event. You can get it using YourEvent.class . That's it, you created an event. Don't forget to check it for bugs! Warning IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor. A correct constructor takes a single Instruction argument. Writing conditions \ud83d\udd17 Writing conditions is easy too. They must extend Condition and override execute(String playerID) method, which should return true or false , depending on if the condition was met. You register them using registerConditions(String name, Class<? extends Condition) method from BetonQuest instance as well. The rest is almost the same, you're defining the constructor which will parse the Instruction object and overriding execute(String playerID) method to check if the player meets the condition. Don't worry about inverting it, as it's automatically done by BetonQuest. Conditions are always getting an online player in the execute(String playerID) method, so you don't need to check that manually. Warning IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor. A correct constructor takes a single Instruction argument. Writing objectives \ud83d\udd17 Objectives are more complicated because they use event handlers and they must store players' data. They extend Objective class. As always, you need to extract all data from supplied Instruction object in the constructor. Don't register listeners in the constructor! If your objective handles changing data (like amount of mobs left to kill) you should create a class extending ObjectiveData . For example block objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database. The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the toString() method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call update() method. It will save the data to the database. Now you should override getDefaultDataInstruction() method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in tame objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not null , just \"\" ). In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the template variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the template simply to ObjectiveData.class . Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with checkConditions() method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call completeObjective() method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually. start() and stop() methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example delay objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners. If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the String getProperty(String property, String playerID) method. At runtime, if anyone uses %objective.yourObjective.theProperty% variable, BetonQuest will call that method with theProperty keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String. If the supplied property name is incorrect or there was an error during getting the value, return an empty String and optionally log an error ( LogUtils.getLogger().log(...) ). Objectives are registered the same way as conditions and events, using registerObjective(String name, Class<? extends Objective>) method. Warning IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor. A correct constructor takes a single Instruction argument. Reading Instruction object \ud83d\udd17 The Instruction object parses the instruction string defined by the user and splits it into arguments. You can ask it for required arguments one by one with next() method or a parser method like getQuestItem() . Required arguments are the ones specified at the very beginning of an instruction string, for example add someTag in tag event. It will automaticly throw InstructionParseException for you if it encounters an error, for example when there were no more arguments in user's instruction or it can't parse the argument to the type you asked for. You can also ask for optional arguments: if the instruction string contains argument arg:something and you ask for optional arg , it will give you something . If there is no optional argument, it will return null . Don't worry about passing that null to parser methods like getLocation(String) , they won't throw an error, they'll simply return that null . Parser methods are there for your convenience. You could write a location parser for yourself, but there's no need for that, you can just use getLocation() or getLocation(String) method and receive LocationData object. The former method is simply getLocation(next()) . If your instruction is more complicated and Instruction class doesn't provide necessary methods, you can still parse the instruction string manually. You can get it with getInstruction() method. Just remember to throw InstructionParseException when the instruction supplied by the user is incorrect. BetonQuest will catch them and display a message in the console. Writing variables \ud83d\udd17 All variables need to extend Variable class. In the constructor you must parse the instruction and extract all information about your variable's behavior. Then you have to override the String getValue(String playerID) method. It should return the value of the variable for the supplied player. If it's impossible, it should return an empty String. Registering variables is done via BetonQuest.registerVariable(String name, Class<? extends Variable> variable) method. Firing events \ud83d\udd17 The plugin has a static method for firing events - event(String playerID, EventID eventID) . First parameter is ID of the player. Second one represents ID of the event. To get it, simply create an instance of the EventID class. You can't fire an event directly using an instruction string. Checking conditions \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest has static boolean method condition(String playerID, String conditionID) . It works similarly as event method described above. Starting objectives \ud83d\udd17 The newObjective(String playerID, String objectiveID) method will launch the objective from start. You can however use resumeObjective(String playerID, String objectiveID, String instruction) to pass your own ObjectiveData instruction to the objective. It will not be saved to the database, because it is assumed that the objective has just been loaded from it and it exists there without any change. You should save it manually. Creating additional conversation input/output methods \ud83d\udd17 In order to register an object as the conversation input/output it needs to implement ConversationIO interface. The constructor will receive three arguments: Conversation object, playerID String and NPC name String. It needs to parse the required data here and register all needed listeners. The setResponse(String response) method will receive NPC's text from the conversation. The addOption(String option) method will be called by the conversation for each reply option for this NPC text. The object must store all this data and when display() is called, it must use it to display the player the output. When it detects that the player chose an answer, it should pass it to the conversation using Conversation.passPlayerAnswer(int number) method. The integer is the number of the answer, starting at 1. clear() method will be called at the beginning of the new conversation cycle. It should clear all the previous options, so they do not overlap. end() method will be called when the conversation ends and it should unregister all listeners. You can also call that message when you detect that the player forced conversation ending (for example by moving away from the NPC). Remember to notify the conversation about that using Conversation.end() . Registering the conversation inputs/outputs is done in the same way as objectives, events and conditions, through BetonQuest.registerConversationIO(String name, Class<? extends ConversationIO>) method. Listening to BetonQuest (Bukkit) events \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest calls Bukkit events on a few occasions: when a conversation is started, finished and when an option is selected. You can find these events in org.betonquest.betonquest.api package and use them in your plugins. If you need any additional events just open and issue on GitHub or send me a pull request. Debugging \ud83d\udd17 You can debug your code using LogUtils class by simply call LogUtils.getlogger().log(..) to log something. We use the following levels for this aspects: - SEVER - Anything happen, that breaks the plugin, or a main function of the plugin - WARNING - The most things, where something not normal or unexpected happens, but the plugin still work correctly for the rest(all catch blocks, when not SEVER) - INFO - Anything you want to log, that also should appear in the normal console - CONFIG - Not in use at the moment - FINE - All messages, that you want to only appear in the debug log file, not in the console - FINER - Do not use this, this is reserved, for exception logging, like you call LogUtils.logThrowable or LogUtils.logThrowableIgnore - FINEST - Not in use at the moment If you have a catch block, please log this with a message, that calls exception.getMessage() and log the complete exception by using the Logutils.logThrowable(e) . The methods logThrowableReport() and logThrowableIgnore() may only be executed by BetonQuest.","title":"\u2699\ufe0f API"},{"location":"API/API/#accessing-the-plugin","text":"Warning All existing API will break in BetonQuest 2.0 which is being worked on while you read this.

For example block objective does need to store amount of blocks left to place/break, and it does that using \"BlockData\" class. In the constructor it receives three strings: data string, ID of the player and ID of the objective. The latter two are used by BetonQuest to correctly save and load the former one from the database. The data string should contains all the information you need in your objective. You must write a parser which will extract the information, methods used in the objective to alter the information, and override the toString() method in so it returns data string in the format parsable by your parser. Everytime the data in your object changes (like when killing a mob), you need to call update() method. It will save the data to the database. Now you should override getDefaultDataInstruction() method. It must return the default data instruction understandable by your parser. For example in tame objective it will return the amount of mobs to tame. If you don't use data objects, just return an empty string (not null , just \"\" ). In order for your objective to use the data object you have created you need to set the template variable to this object's class. If you're not defining the data object (because you don't need to handle the changing data), you should set the template simply to ObjectiveData.class . Every time your objective accepts the player's action (for example killing the right mob in MobKill objective) it must be also verified with checkConditions() method. You don't want your objective ignoring all conditions, right? When you decide that the objective is completed you should call completeObjective() method. It will fire all events for you, so you don't have to do this manually. start() and stop() methods must start objective's listeners and stop them accordingly. It's because the plugin turns the objective's listeners off if there are no players having it active. Here usually you will register/unregister listeners, but some objectives may be different. For example delay objective starts and cancels a runnable, instead of using listeners. If your objective has some properties (used in variables) you should override the String getProperty(String property, String playerID) method. At runtime, if anyone uses %objective.yourObjective.theProperty% variable, BetonQuest will call that method with theProperty keyword as the first argument. Using it you should parse the data of the objective and return it as a String. If the supplied property name is incorrect or there was an error during getting the value, return an empty String and optionally log an error ( LogUtils.getLogger().log(...) ). Objectives are registered the same way as conditions and events, using registerObjective(String name, Class<? extends Objective>) method. Warning IDE's typically autocomplete the wrong constructor. A correct constructor takes a single Instruction argument.","title":"Writing objectives"},{"location":"API/API/#reading-instruction-object","text":"The Instruction object parses the instruction string defined by the user and splits it into arguments. You can ask it for required arguments one by one with next() method or a parser method like getQuestItem() . Required arguments are the ones specified at the very beginning of an instruction string, for example add someTag in tag event. It will automaticly throw InstructionParseException for you if it encounters an error, for example when there were no more arguments in user's instruction or it can't parse the argument to the type you asked for. You can also ask for optional arguments: if the instruction string contains argument arg:something and you ask for optional arg , it will give you something . If there is no optional argument, it will return null . Don't worry about passing that null to parser methods like getLocation(String) , they won't throw an error, they'll simply return that null . Parser methods are there for your convenience. You could write a location parser for yourself, but there's no need for that, you can just use getLocation() or getLocation(String) method and receive LocationData object. The former method is simply getLocation(next()) . If your instruction is more complicated and Instruction class doesn't provide necessary methods, you can still parse the instruction string manually. You can get it with getInstruction() method. Just remember to throw InstructionParseException when the instruction supplied by the user is incorrect. BetonQuest will catch them and display a message in the console.","title":"Reading Instruction object"},{"location":"API/API/#writing-variables","text":"All variables need to extend Variable class.

The constructor will receive three arguments: Conversation object, playerID String and NPC name String. It needs to parse the required data here and register all needed listeners. The setResponse(String response) method will receive NPC's text from the conversation. The addOption(String option) method will be called by the conversation for each reply option for this NPC text. The object must store all this data and when display() is called, it must use it to display the player the output. When it detects that the player chose an answer, it should pass it to the conversation using Conversation.passPlayerAnswer(int number) method. The integer is the number of the answer, starting at 1. clear() method will be called at the beginning of the new conversation cycle. It should clear all the previous options, so they do not overlap. end() method will be called when the conversation ends and it should unregister all listeners. You can also call that message when you detect that the player forced conversation ending (for example by moving away from the NPC).

However, API states help you understand how finalized an API part is. Unfinished This part of the API is brand-new. It will be changed if there are any bugs, missing features or usability improvements. It is not recommended relying on this part of the API, it will most likely change.

Therefore, please go ahead and use this API part. Let us know if there are missing features or bugs. This API part will be changed if there are more bugs, missing features or usability improvements. Please use this part of the API and give us feedback! Stable Both our own and third party testing showed that this part of the API is complete. Only bugs and major conceptual problems would lead to more changes. This part of the API should be safe to use. We try to keep it compatible with previous versions if changes are needed. This page shows you everything you need to know about the BetonQuest logger, no matter if you are working on BetonQuest itself or an integration / addon. Why a custom Logger? \ud83d\udd17 The main advantage is that it is easier to use . It provides an easy interface that enables custom logging features and respects our logging conventions. This helps to provide a great user experience and keeps the log consistent. Advantages \ud83d\udd17 These advantages are mainly for BetonQuest, but it is also very useful for 3 rd party integrations. In-Game Logging Users can see all log messages send, using the BetonQuestLogger in-game. Additionally, these messages can be filtered by quest package and log level. Debug Logging BetonQuest has its own log folder in which a latest.log file is written if debug logging is enabled. It contains our own log messages and messages from 3 rd party integrations. Additional debug messages are logged next to everything that is displayed on the console already. You can send debug log messages directly to that log when you use the BetonQuestLogger in your addon. This will make it a lot easier to see how your plugin integrates with BetonQuest's mechanics if a bug occurs. Log History It happens very often that a user experiences a bug while debug logging is not enabled. We keep the last x configured minutes of the debug log history saved in memory. Therefore, the history will be written to latest.log once you enable \"Debug Logging\" via command. Logger Topics The BetonQuestLogger supports topics, which give your log messages a prefix like (Database) . You can use a topic for each class or for each BetonQuestLogger instance. Topics are supposed to give important log messages extra attention by making them stand out. Obtaining a BetonQuestLogger Instance \ud83d\udd17 Using Lombock Using Lombock enables you to use the handy @CustomLog annotation on each class you want a logger for. This requires a Lombock setup in your project and in your IDE. 1. Setup The first step is to install a Lombok plugin in your IDE. IntelliJ contains it by default. All 3 rd party plugins need to create a new file named lombok.config in their projects root. Copy the following to the file: 1 2 lombok.log.custom.declaration = org.betonquest.betonquest.api.BetonQuestLogger org.betonquest.betonquest.api.BetonQuestLogger.create(TYPE)(TYPE,TOPIC) lombok.log.fieldName = LOG Additionally, Lombock also needs to be setup for the project. The exact configuration depends on your project setup. 2. Usage Simply add the @CustomLog annotation to any class definition. This will not work on any class that extends Plugin , see the warning box below for more information.

I'm sorry for that. Ask devs to update these plugins. - The error reporting feature was improved. If you see a lot of error messages when reloading the plugin (not stack traces, just regular, human-readable messages), it's probably because there are real problems in your quests. - BetonQuest won't accept \".yml\" extensions at the end of conversation names in \"main.yml\". If your conversations aren't working (the plugin says they don't exist), check if you have these extensions IN THE \"MAIN.YML\" file and remove them. Fixed \ud83d\udd17 'action' objective now detects fire interaction 'empty' condition now skips armor and off-hand slots Items can be used cross-package New sound names are now used by default Fixed doubled quest items when dropping them is blocked by another plugin Lore and name now appear on heads and written books with custom data Fix error when trying to add air (empty hand) with \"/q item\" command Main page now can exceed a single page in the journal The plugin will reconnect to the database if something goes wrong Fishing objective now only accepts stuff from water Properties in 'mobkill' objective (left and amount) has switched places Changes \ud83d\udd17 Complete rewrite of item conditioning - read the docs to discover new features (previous syntax is still working without any behavior changes) Books in items.yml now automatically wrap pages, like the journal and main page Main page and entries in the journal can manually split pages with '|' character New lines in conversations can be made with \"\\n\" Interval in 'delay' objective is now configurable 'craft' and 'potion' objectives now use items defined in items.yml file Potion items are now defined with 'type:' argument instead of data value You can now use spaces between \"first\" options in conversations Static events can now be fired with \"/q event - eventID\" command Locations can have vectors defined directly in instruction strings Locations can be variables which resolve to location format Point condition can now check exact point amount with 'equal' argument In 'chest' conversation IO items can be specified with durability values after a colon Mobs spawned with 'spawn' event can have armor, items in hands and custom drops Unbreakability of quest items can be disabled (if you want to use \"unbreakable\" tag instead) Ranges in locations are now a separate argument (\"10;20;30;world;4\" is now \"10;20;30;world 4\") \"main.yml\" is now the only required file in the package. Empty files can be deleted Custom settings (i.e. EffectLib particle effects) are moved from \"main.yml\" to \"custom.yml\" Added \ud83d\udd17 Compatibility with Shopkeepers ('shopkeeper' event, 'shopamount' condition) Compatibility with PlaceholderAPI ('ph' variable and 'betonquest' placeholder) Compatibility with HolographicDisplays (holograms visible based on conditions) Compatibility with RacesAndClasses (race, class, exp, level, mana conditions/events/variables) Compatibility with LegendQuest (race, class, attribute, karma conditions/variables) Compatibility with WorldEdit ('paste' a schematic event) New condition 'riding' - check if the player is riding an entity New condition 'world' - check the world in which the player is New condition 'gamemode' - check player's game mode New condition 'achievement' - check if the player has an achievement New condition 'variable' - check if a variable matches a pattern New event 'lever' - switches a lever New event 'door' - opens/closes doors, trapdoors and gates New event 'if' - run one of two events, depending on condition New event 'movenpc' - move Citizens NPC to a location New event 'variable' - set a variable in \"variable\" objective New objective 'vehicle' - entering a vehicle entity New objective 'variable' - lets players define their own variables for you to use New objective 'kill' - kill players who meet specified conditions New objective 'breed' - breed animals (only 1.10.2+) New variable '%location%' - resolves to player's location Keyword \"unbreakable\" can be used in items to make them unbreakable When a conversation option is selected, a Bukkit event is called (for developers) Chat can be paused while in conversation, it will display when finished Objectives can be completed for players with \"/q objective player complete\" Option 'full_main_page' controls if the main page is a separate page in the journal Mobs spawned with 'spawn' can be \"marked\"; you can require marked mobs in 'mobkill' objective Firework support in items Relative package paths, where '_' means \"one package up\" [1.8.5] - 2016-05-14 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Objectives are now correctly deleted with \"objective delete\" event and do notreappear after \"/q reload\". Objectives are no longer duplicated in the database when using \"/q reload\". [1.8.4] - 2016-05-06 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Conversations are no longer started twice [1.8.3] - 2016-05-06 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Events are no longer run in async thread when completing \"password\" objective Replaced stacktrace with error message when objective is incorrect in \"objective\" event Made color codes work with \"one_entry_per_page\" setting enabled Fixed a bug where taken backpack items were not removed from the database Quest items can now be equipped \"die\" objective now correctly handles damage done to the player Fixed error when conversation is started without any possible options Fixed error when killing NPCs with equipment Fixed problems with relogging while in conversations with \"stop\" option enabled Fixed error when loading corrupted item from the database Changes \ud83d\udd17 Updater is now based on GitHub Releases, no longer downloads major updates automatically, it is more configurable and can also download development versions with \"/q update --dev\" Added \ud83d\udd17 Added console message about the cause of \"/q give\" errors (tells you what is wrong with item instruction string) [1.8.2] - 2016-02-18 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Fixed NPE when killing a mob without any \"mobkill\" objectives [1.8.1] - 2016-02-18 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Removing journal entries from the database now works correctly MobKill objective now correctly handles kills Nested package names are now correctly resolved The formatting at the end of every main page line is reset Fixed Apache dependency problem Material name is no longer displayed in \"chest\" GUI conversations Fixed \"notify\" option in give/take events [1.8] - 2016-02-13 \ud83d\udd17 Notes: - As always in big updates, compatibility with plugins hooking into BetonQuest is broken. You need to check if everything is working. Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Die objective now reacts to death caused by other plugins Static events now are started correctly Static events now are canceled correctly Action objective now correctly checks locations Combat tag is removed after death Block, Craft and MythicMobs MobKill objectives now correctly save data Take event now correctly takes items from inventory, armor slots and backpack Added \ud83d\udd17 New variable system in conversations (check out the documentation) More options for journal, including one entry per page and removing date Compatibility with mcMMO (level condition and experience event) Compatibility with EffectLib ('particle' event, NPC particles) Compatibility with PlayerPoints (points event and condition) Compatibility with Heroes (class and skill condition, experience event, Heroes kills in 'mobkill' objective) Compatibility with Magic ('wand' condition) Compatibility with Denizen (running task scripts with 'script' event) Compatibility with SkillAPI (class and level condition) Compatibility with Quests (checking for done quests, starting them, custom event reward, custom condition requirement) Optional prefix for conversations (contributed by Jack McKalling) Optional material for buttons in \"chest\" conversation IO Configurable main page in the journal New argument in objectives: \"persistent\" - makes them repeat after completing New condition 'check' - allows for specifying multiple instructions in one New condition 'objective' - checks if the player has an active objective New condition 'score' - check scores on scoreboards New condition 'chestitem' - checks if a chest contains items New event 'run' - allows for specifying multiple instructions in one New event 'givejournal' - gives journal to the player New event 'sudo' - forces the player to run a command New event 'compass' - point player's compass to a location New event 'cancel' - cancels a quest (as in main.yml) New event 'score' - modify scores on scoreboards New events 'chestgive', 'chesttake' and 'chestclear' - put and remove items in chests New objective 'logout' - the player needs to leave the server New objective 'password' - the player needs to type the password in the chat New objective 'fish' - catching fish New objective 'enchant' - enchanting an item New objective 'shear' - shearing a sheep New objective 'chestput' - putting items in a chest New objective 'potion' - brewing a potion New commands: /cancelquest and /compass - directly open backpack sub-pages New subcommand '/q delete' - delete all specific tags/points/objectives/entries New subcommand '/q rename' - rename all specific tags/points/objectives/entries New subcommand '/q give' - gives you an item from items.yml Changes \ud83d\udd17 Administrative messages are now English-only in new installations Journal event can remove entries from the journal In conversations, %quester% variable changed to %npc% In inventory GUI there is NPC's text in every option, for convenience Conversations can point to NPC options in other conversations within the package You can use spaces between events, conditions and pointers in conversations All tags and points are internally associated with a package now Some conditions are now static and persistent (just like events) Point event can now multiply points Vault Money event can now multiply money Journal event can now use \"update\" argument for updating variables on the main page Packages can now be moved to another directories Quest cancelers are now defined in a more convenient way /q command renamed to /betonquest, /j to /journal; previous forms are now aliases Conditions and events in objective instructions (and conditions in event instructions) can now be defined with \"condition:\" and \"event:\" argument (without \"s\" at the end) [1.7.6] - 2015-10-17 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Conversation can no longer be started multiple times at once if it happens on the same tick Added \ud83d\udd17 Dutch translation by Jack McKalling [1.7.5] - 2015-09-12 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Restored compatibility with MythicMobs 2.1.0 [1.7.4] - 2015-08-29 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Fixed error when player was quitting with active \"stop\" conversation while he had not changed his language with /ql command Changes \ud83d\udd17 Inventory GUI will close itself if there's nothing left to display [1.7.3] - 2015-08-20 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Combat tagging does not work if the attack has been canceled Changes \ud83d\udd17 Options in conversation can also be defined using \"event:\", \"condition:\" and \"pointers:\" argument names (with and without 's' at the end). \"text:\" argument is unchanged. [1.7.2] - 2015-07-27 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 \"mobkill\" objective now displays correct amount of mobs left to kill \"delay\" objective can be set to 0 delay [1.7.1] - 2015-07-19 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Quests are loaded after other plugins register their types Journal condition correctly resolves package names Changes \ud83d\udd17 Updated French translation [1.7] - 2015-07-17 \ud83d\udd17 Notes: - BetonQuest no longer supports servers without UUID handling - There were a lot of changes since previous version, check carefully if everything is working - Compatibility with plugins hooking INTO BetonQuest is broken, they need to update Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Objectives no longer mysteriously double events Greatly improved performance in almost every aspect Finally fixed issues with special characters on some servers Fixed database saving/loading issues Fixed player options in conversations being white on next lines when using tellraw Added \ud83d\udd17 Quest canceling system New inventory GUI for conversations Added the \"random\" parameter in \"folder\" event - choose randomly X events to fire Action objective can be \"canceled\" - the click will not do anything Added \"static events\" mechanism for firing events at specified time of the day Optional message when the player is pulled back by stop option Optional message for take and give events Optional message when advancing in \"block\" and \"mobkill\" objectives Variable system for quick changing quest parameters (for example location of a quest) \"/q vector\" command for easy calculating location vector variables New \"empty\" condition - amount of empty inventory slots New \"party\" condition - manages the conditions in the party New \"monsters\" condition - true if there are monsters in the area New \"clear\" event - kills specified monsters in the area New \"region\" objective - reach WorldGuard region Blacklist of commands which cannot be used while in conversation Option to disable compatibility with other plugins Added remove_items_after_respawn option - for servers using keepInventory gamerule Changes \ud83d\udd17 The plugin now uses package system: configuration has been moved into \"default\" package Objectives has returned to \"objectives.yml\" - it's improving performance The database is now updated in real time All quests can (but don't have to) be translated into multiple languages Players can change their language with /questlang command Conversations with stop option are resumed when the player logs out and in again Metrics are now toggled in PluginMetrics/config.yml All conditions, events, objectives, conversations etc. are loaded when the plugin starts/reloads Citizens NPC will stop when talked to Quest blocks cannot be placed, quest items will not break Conversations cannot be started while in combat Cannot fight while in conversation Tellraw conversations no longer spam the console Mobs can be spawned with a name (spawnmob event, \"name:\" argument) /q command is now more beautiful Removed unnecessary argument prefixes from conditions and events Removed \"tag:\" from objective instruction strings Conversations no longer need those empty lines everywhere ('') Dependencies updated: WorldGuard/WorldEdit 6.1, MythicMobs 2.0.4 [1.6.2] - 2015-04-10 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed errors on data loading when MySQL is being used. Changes messages system to use simple file as default. If you want to use advanced translation just rename \"advanced-messages.yml\" to \"messages.yml\". [1.6.1] - 2015-03-26 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed errors on updating journals when using MySQL. [1.6] - 2015-03-16 \ud83d\udd17 Notes: - There is a bug/feature in 1.8 which adds '\u00a70' at the end of every line in books generated by plugins. This breaks the conditions/events based on books with more than one line of text. The detailed instruction on how to work it around is in \"Other important stuff\" chapter, in the part about items. Fixed \ud83d\udd17 Items given by event that don't fit in the inventory will now drop instead of being deleted This does not apply to quest items, they will be added to backpack Events fired from conversations won't throw async errors Conversation can be started after plugin's reload without relogging /q reload no longer lags the server Corrected description in /q command Added input validation for global locations - if event is incorrect it will display an error instead of breaking the whole functionality The plugin should run fine on machines not supporting some special characters Inverted item condition now behave correctly Time condition now checks time correctly Added \ud83d\udd17 Added backpack for storing quest items, which cannot be dropped in any way Added database backups Added prefix for the database. New installations will use \"betonquest_\" prefix for tables, existing configuration will use empty prefix to maintain compatibility with other programs Players can chat while in conversations by prefixing their messages with '#' character New \"random\" condition - true with specified probability New \"sneak\" condition - true if player is sneaking New \"journal\" condition - true if player has journal entry New \"testforblock\" condition - true if block at given location matches given material New \"arrow\" objective - completed when arrow hits the specified target New \"experience\" objective - completed when player reaches certain level New \"npcinteract\" objective - completed when player right-clicks Citizens NPC New \"damage\" event - damages the player Skript support (event, effect and condition) WorldGuard support (region condition) Errors are logged to the \"error.log\" file in \"logs\" directory Debug option in config.yml for logging plugin's activity to \"debug.log\" file New commands for opening backpack: b, bb, backpack, bbackpack or betonbackpack Items are now aware of leather armor color, head owner and enchantments in books Changes \ud83d\udd17 Added and changed a lot of subcommands in /q command: event and condition can be run for every online player tag, point, objective and (new) journal can edit every (even offline) player config (new) can set configuration files from command line backup (new) backups the whole configuration and database Folder event now runs these events even after the player logs out: command, tag, objective, delete, point, setblock Changed /j command to open the backpack instead of just giving the journal Tellraw clicking on options in conversation now ignores old (used) options Using color codes in journal entries is now possible Give/take events and item condition can now check for multiple items with syntax 'give stick:2,stone:4,sword' Give/take events and item/hand conditions can now check for items only without enchantments/effects/name/lore etc. Inverting condition is now done by prefixing their name with \"!\" (in the place where you use them, like conversation, not in conditions.yml) Configuration updater is no longer based on plugin's version Backup files are now kept in \"backups\" directory, old ones are moved to it Changed internal structure of the code (may matter to developers - QuestEvent, Condition and Objective classes has been moved from \"core\" package to \"api\", update your imports) [1.5.4] - 2015-03-12 \ud83d\udd17 This version is almost the same as 1.5.3. The only difference is that it can load database backups created by 1.6 version. When updating to 1.6, the database format will change, so it won't be possible to go back, unless by loading the backup using this version of the plugin. [1.5.3] - 2014-12-26 \ud83d\udd17 Small fix of /q purge command not working on offline players. [1.5.2] - 2014-12-23 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed errors that were spamming the console when a player with active Location objective was teleporting to other worlds. [1.5.1] - 2014-12-22 \ud83d\udd17 Changes \ud83d\udd17 Multiple tags in one event are now possible Change /q event command to run from console Add color codes to item's name and lore Fix \"stop\" option in conversations not working Fix NPE on unknown answer in conversations [1.5] - 2014-12-21 \ud83d\udd17 Changes \ud83d\udd17 Added support for MythicMobs and Vault (see wiki for more info) AutoUpdater is now enabled by default! If you want you can change this and reload the plugin, nothing will be downloaded in that case Books saving format has changed. All books were automatically converted, but you need to check them if everything looks like it's supposed to. Command event accepts multiple commands separated by \"|\", eg. \"command say beton|say quest\" Event command now accepts optional argument at the end; this will fire event for player. eg. \"/q event wood_reward Steve\" Journal title and lore can now use colors (&4 etc.) and journal is colorful; options in config.yml Added aliases for /q command: bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests Added aliases for /j command: bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal Objectives are now defined directly in event instruction, not in objectives.yml (which was deleted, if you want to restore something check the backup) Replies in conversations are now optionally clickable (tellraw option in config.yml) Added permission for starting a conversation: betonquest.conversation Conversation starting/ending, updating journal, plugin's update and full inventory can now make sounds; you can find a list of possible values here: jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Sound.html Conditions for events are now defined as 'event_conditions:' instead of simply 'conditions:'. This is to distinguish conditions for objectives and for events, as both of them can exist in one instruction Updater is now run when disabling the plugin (it does matter if your server restarts every night) Notes: All Objective events has been converted to new format. The objectives.yml file has been deleted, so if it contained any objectives that weren't covered by an event they may seem lost. However there is a backup file and you can easily extract everything from it. Please refer to the wiki to learn how objectives are now defined or just study converted ones (it's pretty straightforward). AutoUpdater is now enabled by default. Every future update will be working exactly like before, all changes will be automatically updated by a converter, there is always a backup and you are informed about all changes in this file. So it's pretty safe to say that keeping this plugin up to date won't give you any trouble. If you don't want to have latest fixes and features you can disable updating but this will make the developer sad. Because of changes in how books behave since 1.8 you may experience some strange bugs with saving books to items.yml. Generally you should open a book before saving it using /q item command. And don't start or end your books with \" character, as it's part of a workaround of this bug/feature. [1.4.3] - 2014-12-15 \ud83d\udd17 Removed debug messages from ActionObjective. You could have told me, any of you guys... [1.4.2] - 2014-12-09 \ud83d\udd17 Really fixed an updater. [1.4.1] - 2014-12-09 \ud83d\udd17 Fixed few bugs in Action objective. Fixed updater, hopefully. [1.4] - 2014-12-07 \ud83d\udd17 Changes \ud83d\udd17 Conversations are now divided into multiple files in \"conversations\" directory Items are now saved to items.yml file and referenced by \"take\", \"give\", \"item\" and \"hand\" events/conditions Added /q item command which saves currently held item to the config as specified itemID Added location to Action objective, which checks the location of the block (unlike location condition which checks location of the player) Added /q event command which fires specified event Fixed multiple bugs with conversation starting and ending Block NPCs can now be used with Citizens enabled Added NPCKill objective for killing NPCs Added SetBlock event for setting a block at specified location Improved Material matching in configs Modified Action objective for greater flexibility: It is now possible to detect clicking in air It is no longer possible to detect clicking on any block (as this accepts clicking on air) Can be used to detect book reading (with help of updated Hand condition) Added AutoUpdater; it's disabled by default Notes: Conversion of configuration should have been done automatically, you don't have to worry about anything. If something went wrong you can revert changes from generated backup file, which contains all your previous configs. You can enable AutoUpdater by setting \"autoupdate\" to true in config.yml. It is completely safe because all next versions will generate backups and convert all files automatically. You will be notified on joining the server about new changelog file. Please refer to the wiki for changes in formatting instruction strings for various things: https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/wiki You probably should also change names of converted items to something else than \"item12\". But that works too of course. [1.3] - 2014-11-30 \ud83d\udd17 Changes \ud83d\udd17 UUID support (optional) NPCs made from a clay block, head and sign, for servers without Citizens2 plugin Global, long and persistent delay for events (as an objective) Folder event for multiple events, with optional short delay French translation (thanks to fastlockel) If you want to convert names to UUIDs run the plugin once and then change in the config \"uuid: false\" to true. Do not touch the \"convert: true\" option unless you want your database wiped! Conversion will happen on next plugin reload (eg. /q reload). This is not revertable! Remember to backup your config files before updating! It shouldn't destroy anything but you never know. [1.2] - 2014-11-23 \ud83d\udd17 Global locations now automatically run only once, no need for blocking it with tags and conditions. They use however tags that follow the syntax \"global_ \", where is global location objective tag. Added optional respawn location for cancelled death objective, just add \"respawn:100.5;200;300.5;world;90;0\" to instruction string. Added German translation, thanks to coalaa! Added optional movement blocking while in conversation, just add option \"stop: true\" or \"stop: false\" in every conversation. Changed priority of conversation chat event to lowest, should work even for muted players. Fixed data values in block objective. Added metrics, you can disable them by setting \"metrics: false\" in config.yml Added support for SQLite, plugin will use it when connecting to MySQL fails.

If you want you can change this and reload the plugin, nothing will be downloaded in that case Books saving format has changed. All books were automatically converted, but you need to check them if everything looks like it's supposed to. Command event accepts multiple commands separated by \"|\", eg. \"command say beton|say quest\" Event command now accepts optional argument at the end; this will fire event for player. eg. \"/q event wood_reward Steve\" Journal title and lore can now use colors (&4 etc.) and journal is colorful; options in config.yml Added aliases for /q command: bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests Added aliases for /j command: bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal Objectives are now defined directly in event instruction, not in objectives.yml (which was deleted, if you want to restore something check the backup) Replies in conversations are now optionally clickable (tellraw option in config.yml) Added permission for starting a conversation: betonquest.conversation Conversation starting/ending, updating journal, plugin's update and full inventory can now make sounds; you can find a list of possible values here: jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Sound.html Conditions for events are now defined as 'event_conditions:' instead of simply 'conditions:'. This is to distinguish conditions for objectives and for events, as both of them can exist in one instruction Updater is now run when disabling the plugin (it does matter if your server restarts every night) Notes: All Objective events has been converted to new format. The objectives.yml file has been deleted, so if it contained any objectives that weren't covered by an event they may seem lost. However there is a backup file and you can easily extract everything from it. Please refer to the wiki to learn how objectives are now defined or just study converted ones (it's pretty straightforward). AutoUpdater is now enabled by default. Every future update will be working exactly like before, all changes will be automatically updated by a converter, there is always a backup and you are informed about all changes in this file. So it's pretty safe to say that keeping this plugin up to date won't give you any trouble. If you don't want to have latest fixes and features you can disable updating but this will make the developer sad. Because of changes in how books behave since 1.8 you may experience some strange bugs with saving books to items.yml. Generally you should open a book before saving it using /q item command.

Main command details \ud83d\udd17 Reloading loads all data from configuration, but not everything is updated. Player's data isn't touched to avoid lags made by database saving. The database is also the same, you will have to reload/restart the whole server for the database to change. Tags subcommand allows you to easily list and modify tags. ' /q tags Beton ' would list tags for player Beton. ' /q tags Beton add test ' would add \"test\" tag for that player, and ' /q tags Beton del test ' would remove it. Points subcommand is similar - listing points is done the same way. Adding points to a category looks like that: ' /q points Beton add reputation 20 ' (adding 20 points to \"reputation\" category). You can also subtract points with negative amounts. Removing the whole point category can be achieved by ' /q points Beton del reputation '. Journal subcommand works in the same way as those two above. Adding and removing looks like /q journal Beton add default.wood_started (or del ), and you can also specify the date of entry when adding it, by appending date written like this: 23.04.2014_16:52 at the end of the command. Note that there is _ character instead of space! Objective subcommand allows you to list all active objectives (shown as their labels) of the player. It can also directly add or cancel objectives using instruction strings. You can also complete the objective for the player using complete argument - it will run all events and remove the objective. Running events for online players can be done with event argument: ' /q event Beton give_emeralds ' would run \"give_emeralds\" for player Beton (if he's online) from default package (not necessarily \"default\" but rather the default one specified in config.yml ). If you want to run a static event, replace player's name with - . There is also condition argument for checking conditions, for example ' /q condition Beton has_food '. Events and conditions need to be defined in their files, this command doesn't accept raw instructions. You can skip package name, the plugin will assume you're reffering to package specified in default_package option in config.yml file. If you want to check a static condition replace the player's name with - . If you need to create for example \"Nettlebane\" quest item, just hold it in your hand and type ' /q item nettlebane '. It will copy the item you're holding into the items.yml file and save it there with the name you specified (in this case \"nettlebane\"). You can skip the package name here as well. The ' /q give package.item ' command will simply give you specified item. Config subcommand is used to modify or display values in configuration files. set option replaces the value with what you typed, add simply adds your string to the existing value. (Note on spaces: by default the plugin won't insert a space between existing and added value. You can however achieve that by prefixing the string with _ character. For example: existing string is objective location , and you want to add 100;200;300;world;10 . Your command will look like /q config add default.events.loc_obj _100;200;300;world;10 ). read option allows you to display config value without modifying it. Path in this command is like an address of the value. Next branches are separated by dots. For example language setting in main configuration has path config.language , and a text in \"bye\" player option in default quest has path default.conversations.innkeeper.player_options.bye.text You can purge specific player with ' /q purge Beton ' command, where Beton is the name of the player. To purge the entire database at once simply change the prefix in config.yml or delete database.db file. Delete command (' /q delete ') allows you to delete from the database every tag, point, objective or journal entry with specified name. Rename command (' /q rename ') allows you to rename every tag, point, globalpoint, objective or journal entry in the database. In case of an objective it will also rename the objective in objectives.yml , so it continues to work correctly. If you want to backup your configuration and database make sure that your server is empty (this process requires all data to be saved to database -> all players offline) and run ' /q backup ' command. You will get a zip file containing all your data, ready to be unzipped for restoring the plugin. Update command (' /q update ') will try to download the newest version of the plugin and save it to the update folder. This folder is then handled by Spigot to update the plugin. If you accidentally use this command but do not wish to update the plugin, you should remove BetonQuest.jar file from the plugins/update folder before restarting/reloading the server. Using ' /q create beton ' command you will create new package named ' beton '. It will contain the default quest. The /q vector command allows you to create vector variables from the specified in first argument location variable to your position. The result will be saved to the \"vectors.{second argument}\" variable. The debug command (' /q debug ') allows you to enable or disable the debug mode. If the debug mode is enabled after server startup (' /q debug true '), all log entries from the configured log history time frame are written to the /plugins/BetonQuest/logs/latest.log file as history and writing will be continued until the debug mode is disabled using (' /q debug false '). The latest.log is renamed to the current date and time on server startup. It's useful if you search for more information about an issue and can help developers to fix bugs. The command (' /q debug ingame ') allows you to manage your ingame debugging. The ingame debugging sends you live information about quests to your chat. Running the command without any argument shows your active filters. If you don't have any filters active you will see all console output from /q reload . If you have filters active you only see information from the selected packages. Appending a package name activates the filter for that package. You can also use * / MyFolder-* instead of a package name to address all packages / all packages of a folder. Appending a level allows you to select which types of messages are displayed. The default level error shows all WARNINGS and ERRORS from the log. If you want to see more information use the levels info or debug . Beware though, the debug level might be spammy.","title":"\ud83d\udd12 Permissions & Commands"},{"location":"Documentation/Commands-and-permissions/#commands-and-permissions","text":"","title":"Commands and permissions"},{"location":"Documentation/Commands-and-permissions/#commands","text":"/j - gives the journal /backpack - opens the backpack /q - lists all available admin commands /q reload - reloads the plugin /q objectives {playerName} [list/add/del/complete] [instruction] - shows player's currently active objectives /q tags {playerName} [list/add/del] [tag] - lists all player's tags /q globaltags {playerName} [list/add/del] [tag] - lists all global tags /q points {playerName} [list/add/del] [category] [amount] - lists all player's points in all categories /q globalpoints {playerName} [list/add/del] [category] [amount] /q journal {playerName} [list/add/del] [package.pointer] [date] /q event {playerName} {package.eventID} - fires an event for the player /q condition {playerName} {package.conditionID} - shows if the player meet specified condition or not /q item {package.itemID} - creates an item based on what you're holding in hand /q give {package.itemID} - gives you an item defined in the configuration /q config {set/add/read} {path} [value] - sets, adds or reads values from configuration /q purge {playerName} - deletes all player's data from the database /q rename {tag/point/globalpoint/objective/entry} {oldName} {newName} - renames all specified things in the database /q delete {tag/point/objective/entry} {name} - deletes all specified things in the database /q backup - creates a backup of configuration files and database /q update - updates the plugin to the newest version. /q create {package} : creates new package with given name, filled with default quest /q vector {packname.variable} {newvariable} : calculates the vector from first location variable to you position and saves it as second variable /q version : displays the versions of BetonQuest, the server and all hooked plugins /q debug [true/false/ingame] : enable debug mode and write all down in a log file or disable the debug mode /questlang {lang} - changes the language for the player (and globally if used from console). default language will use the language defined in config.yml .","title":"Commands"},{"location":"Documentation/Commands-and-permissions/#aliases","text":"/j : bj, journal, bjournal, betonjournal, betonquestjournal /backpack : b, bb, bbackpack, betonbackpack, betonquestbackpack /q : bq, bquest, bquests, betonquest, betonquests, quest, quests objective : o, objectives tag : t, tags point : p, points event : e, events condition : c, conditions journal : j, journals item : i, items give : g rename : r delete : d, del create : package /questlang : ql","title":"Aliases"},{"location":"Documentation/Commands-and-permissions/#permissions","text":"betonquest.admin - allows using admin commands (/q ...) and creating an NPC from blocks betonquest.journal - allows using /j command (default for players) betonquest.backpack - allows using /backpack command (default for players) betonquest.conversation - allows talking with NPCs (default for players) betonquest.language - allows changing the language (default for players) Warning Don't give betonquest.admin permission to people you don't fully trust.

Removing the whole point category can be achieved by ' /q points Beton del reputation '. Journal subcommand works in the same way as those two above. Adding and removing looks like /q journal Beton add default.wood_started (or del ), and you can also specify the date of entry when adding it, by appending date written like this: 23.04.2014_16:52 at the end of the command. Note that there is _ character instead of space! Objective subcommand allows you to list all active objectives (shown as their labels) of the player. It can also directly add or cancel objectives using instruction strings. You can also complete the objective for the player using complete argument - it will run all events and remove the objective. Running events for online players can be done with event argument: ' /q event Beton give_emeralds ' would run \"give_emeralds\" for player Beton (if he's online) from default package (not necessarily \"default\" but rather the default one specified in config.yml ). If you want to run a static event, replace player's name with - . There is also condition argument for checking conditions, for example ' /q condition Beton has_food '. Events and conditions need to be defined in their files, this command doesn't accept raw instructions. You can skip package name, the plugin will assume you're reffering to package specified in default_package option in config.yml file. If you want to check a static condition replace the player's name with - . If you need to create for example \"Nettlebane\" quest item, just hold it in your hand and type ' /q item nettlebane '. It will copy the item you're holding into the items.yml file and save it there with the name you specified (in this case \"nettlebane\"). You can skip the package name here as well. The ' /q give package.item ' command will simply give you specified item. Config subcommand is used to modify or display values in configuration files. set option replaces the value with what you typed, add simply adds your string to the existing value. (Note on spaces: by default the plugin won't insert a space between existing and added value. You can however achieve that by prefixing the string with _ character. For example: existing string is objective location , and you want to add 100;200;300;world;10 . Your command will look like /q config add default.events.loc_obj _100;200;300;world;10 ). read option allows you to display config value without modifying it. Path in this command is like an address of the value. Next branches are separated by dots. For example language setting in main configuration has path config.language , and a text in \"bye\" player option in default quest has path default.conversations.innkeeper.player_options.bye.text You can purge specific player with ' /q purge Beton ' command, where Beton is the name of the player. To purge the entire database at once simply change the prefix in config.yml or delete database.db file. Delete command (' /q delete ') allows you to delete from the database every tag, point, objective or journal entry with specified name. Rename command (' /q rename ') allows you to rename every tag, point, globalpoint, objective or journal entry in the database. In case of an objective it will also rename the objective in objectives.yml , so it continues to work correctly. If you want to backup your configuration and database make sure that your server is empty (this process requires all data to be saved to database -> all players offline) and run ' /q backup ' command. You will get a zip file containing all your data, ready to be unzipped for restoring the plugin. Update command (' /q update ') will try to download the newest version of the plugin and save it to the update folder. This folder is then handled by Spigot to update the plugin. If you accidentally use this command but do not wish to update the plugin, you should remove BetonQuest.jar file from the plugins/update folder before restarting/reloading the server. Using ' /q create beton ' command you will create new package named ' beton '. It will contain the default quest. The /q vector command allows you to create vector variables from the specified in first argument location variable to your position. The result will be saved to the \"vectors.{second argument}\" variable. The debug command (' /q debug ') allows you to enable or disable the debug mode. If the debug mode is enabled after server startup (' /q debug true '), all log entries from the configured log history time frame are written to the /plugins/BetonQuest/logs/latest.log file as history and writing will be continued until the debug mode is disabled using (' /q debug false '). The latest.log is renamed to the current date and time on server startup. It's useful if you search for more information about an issue and can help developers to fix bugs. The command (' /q debug ingame ') allows you to manage your ingame debugging. The ingame debugging sends you live information about quests to your chat. Running the command without any argument shows your active filters. If you don't have any filters active you will see all console output from /q reload . If you have filters active you only see information from the selected packages. Appending a package name activates the filter for that package. You can also use * / MyFolder-* instead of a package name to address all packages / all packages of a folder. Appending a level allows you to select which types of messages are displayed. The default level error shows all WARNINGS and ERRORS from the log. If you want to see more information use the levels info or debug . Beware though, the debug level might be spammy.","title":"Main command details"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/","text":"Compatibility \ud83d\udd17 In total 30 plugins have dedicated support for BetonQuest.

The amount can be a variable or a number. The player needs to be on that level or higher to meet the condition. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument, then the player must match the specified level exactly. 1 2 aureliumskillslevel fighting 5 aureliumskillslevel farming 10 equal Stat level: aureliumstatslevel \ud83d\udd17 Checks if the player has the specified stat level. The amount can be a variable or a number. The player needs to be on that level or higher to meet the condition. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument, then the player must match the specified level exactly. 1 2 aureliumstatslevel luck 5 aureliumstatslevel luck 10 equal Events \ud83d\udd17 Give Skill Xp : aureliumskillsxp \ud83d\udd17 Adds experience to the players skill. The amount can be a variable or a number. The level argument is optional and would convert the amount to levels instead of XP points. 1 2 aureliumskillsxp farming 5 aureliumskillsxp farming 10 level Brewery \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Drunk: drunk \ud83d\udd17 This condition is true if the player is drunken. Only argument is the minimal drunkness (0-100). 1 drunk 50 Drunk Quality: drunkquality \ud83d\udd17 This condition is true if the player has the given drunk quality. Only argument is the minimal drunk quality (1-10). 1 drunkquality 3 Has Brew: hasbrew \ud83d\udd17 This condition is true if the player has the given brew with the specified amount in his inventory. 1 hasbrew 2 MY_BREW Events \ud83d\udd17 Give Brew: givebrew \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player the specified drink. The first number is the amount, and the second number is the quality of the drink. 1 givebrew 1 10 MY_BREW Take Brew: takebrew \ud83d\udd17 Removes the specified drink from the players inventory. An amount needs to be specified. 1 takebrew 2 MY_OTHER_BREW NPC's using Citizens \ud83d\udd17 If you have this plugin you can use it's NPCs for conversations. I highly recommend you installing it, it's NPCs are way more immersive. Having Citizens also allows you to use NPCKill objective and to have moving NPC's. A Citizen NPC will only react to right clicks by default. This can be changed by setting acceptNPCLeftClick in the config.yml to true . Notice You need to specify the ID of the NPC instead of it's name in the main.yml when using Citizens! Conditions \ud83d\udd17 NPC distance: npcdistance \ud83d\udd17 This condition will return true if the player is closer to the NPC with the given ID than the given distance. The NPCs ID is the first argument, the distance is the second. If the npc is despawned the condition will return false. Example npcdistance 16 22 NPC location: npclocation \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This condition will return true if a npc is close to a location. First argument is the id of the NPC, second the location and third the maximum distance to the location that the npc is allowed to have. Example npclocation 16 4.0;14.0;-20.0;world 22 NPC region: npcregion \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Notice This condition also requires WorldGuard to work. This condition will return true if a npc is inside a region. First argument is the id of the npc second is the name of the region. Example npcregion 16 spawn Events \ud83d\udd17 Move NPC: movenpc \ud83d\udd17 This event will make the NPC move to a specified location. It will not return on its own, so you have to set a single path point with /npc path command - it will then return to that point every time. If you make it move too far away, it will teleport or break, so beware. You can change maximum pathfinding range in Citizens configuration files. The first argument in this event is ID of the NPC to move. Second one is a location in a standard format (like in teleport event). You can also specify multiple locations separated by colons to let the npc follow a path of locations. You can also specify additional arguments: block will block the NPC so you won't be able to start a conversation with him while he is moving, wait: is a number of tick the NPC will wait at its destination before firing events, done: is a list of events fired after reaching the destination, fail: is a list of events fired if this event fails. Move event can fail if the NPC is already moving for another player. Example movenpc 121 100;200;300;world,105;200;280;world block wait:20 done:msg_were_here,give_reward fail:msg_cant_go,give_reward Stop moving NPC: stopnpc \ud83d\udd17 This will stop all current move tasks for the npc with the given ID. Example stopnpc 16 Teleport NPC: teleportnpc \ud83d\udd17 This event will teleport the NPC with the given ID to the given location. Example teleportnpc 53 100;200;300;world Objectives \ud83d\udd17 NPC Interact: npcinteract \ud83d\udd17 The player has to right-click on the NPC with specified ID. It can also optionally cancel the action, so the conversation won't start. The first argument is number (ID of the NPC), and the second is optional cancel . Example npcinteract 3 cancel conditions:sneak events:steal NPC Kill: npckill \ud83d\udd17 The NPC kill objective requires the player to kill a NPC with the given ID. You can also define how many times the NPC has to be killed. Right after the objective's name there must be the ID of the NPC. You can also add an amount with the amount keyword. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of NPCs already killed, left is the amount of NPCs still needed to kill and total is the amount of NPCs initially required. Example npckill 16 amount:3 events:reward notify NPC Range: npcrange \ud83d\udd17 The player has to enter/leave a circle with the given radius around the NPC to complete this objective. It is also possible to define multiple NPCs separated with , . The objective will be completed as soon as you meet the requirement of just one npc. First argument is the ID of the NPC, second one is the type: Either enter , leave , inside or outside and the third one is the range. The types enter , leave force the player to actually enter the radius after you were outside of it and vice versa. This means that enter is not completed when the player gets the objective and is already in the range, while inside is instantly completed. Example npcrange 3,5 enter 20 events:master_inRange Denizen \ud83d\udd17 Events \ud83d\udd17 Script: script \ud83d\udd17 With this event you can fire Denizen task scripts. Don't confuse it with skript event, these are different. The first and only argument is the name of the script. Example script beton EffectLib \ud83d\udd17 If you install this plugin on your server you will be able to set a particle effect on NPCs with conversations and use particle event. EffectLib is not a normal plugin, it's a developer tool - there are no official docs. However, the Magic plugin has a wiki for EffectLib. It does contain a few magic specific settings though so please don't be confused if some stuff does not work. There is also a magic editor with autocompletion for EffectLib. You can control the behaviour of particles around the NPCs in custom.yml file, in npc_effects section. Each effect is defined as a separate subsection and consists of EffectLib options (described on the EffectLib page) and several BetonQuest settings. npcs is a list of all NPCs on which this effect can be displayed. If no npcs are specified it will use the package NPCs from main.yml . conditions is a list of conditions the player has to meet in order to see the effect. BetonQuest will find the first effect which can be displayed and show it to the player. interval controls how often the effect is displayed (in ticks). The effect will be fired from the exact location of the NPC, upwards. npc_effects : check_interval : 50 disabled : false farmer : class : VortexEffect iterations : 20 particle : crit_magic helixes : 3 circles : 1 grow : 0.1 radius : 0.5 interval : 30 npcs : - 1 conditions : - '!con_tag_started' - '!con_tag_finished' Events \ud83d\udd17 Particle: particle \ud83d\udd17 This event will load an effect defined in effects section in custom.yml file and display it on player's location. The only argument is the name of the effect. You can optionally add loc: argument followed by a location written like 100;200;300;world;180;-90 to put it on that location. If you add private argument the effect will only be displayed to the player for which you ran the event. Example In custom.yml effects : beton : class : HelixEffect iterations : 100 particle : smoke helixes : 5 circles : 20 grow : 3 radius : 30 In events.yml particle beton loc:100;200;300;world;180;-90 private Heroes \ud83d\udd17 When you install Heroes, all kills done via this plugin's skills will be counted in MobKill objectives. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Heroes Class: heroesclass \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks the classes of the player. The first argument must be primary , secondary or mastered . Second is the name of a class or any . You can optionally specify level: argument followed by the required level of the player. Example heroesclass mastered warrior Skill: heroesskill \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player can use specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill. Example heroesskill charge Events \ud83d\udd17 Heroes experience: heroesexp \ud83d\udd17 This event simply gives the player specified amount of Heroes experience. The first argument is either primary or secondary and it means player's class. Second one is the amount of experience to add. Example heroesexp primary 1000 HolographicDisplays \ud83d\udd17 Hidden Holograms \ud83d\udd17 Installing this plugin will enable you to create hidden holograms, which will be shown to players only if they meet specified conditions. Note that you need to have ProtocolLib installed in order to hide holograms from certain players. In order to create a hologram, you have to add holograms section in your custom.yml file. Add a node named as your hologram to this section and define lines , conditions and location subnodes. The fist one should be a list of texts - these will be the lines of a hologram. Color codes are supported. Second is a list of conditions separated by commas. Third is a location in a standard format, like in teleport event. An example of such hologram definition: holograms : beton : lines : - '&bThis is Beton.' - 'item:custom_item' - '&eBeton is strong.' location : 100;200;300;world conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # How often to check conditions (optional) check_interval : 20 A line can also represent a floating item. To do so enter the line as 'item: custom_item '. It will be replaced with the custom_item defined defined in items.yml. If the Item is defined for example as map, a floating map will be seen between two lines of text. The holograms are updated every 10 seconds. If you want to make it faster, add hologram_update_interval option in config.yml file and set it to a number of ticks you want to pass between updates (one second is 20 ticks). Don't set it to 0 or negative numbers, it will result in an error. NPC Holograms \ud83d\udd17 If Citizens is also installed then you can have holograms configured relative to an npc. Add the following to custom.yml . npc_holograms : # How often to check conditions check_interval : 100 # Holograms follow npcs when they move (higher cpu usage when true) follow : false # Disable npc_holograms disabled : false # Hologram Settings default : # Lines in hologram lines : - \"Some text!\" # Vector offset to NPC position to place hologram vector : 0;3;0 # Conditions to display hologram conditions : has_some_quest, !finished_some_quest # NPC's to apply these settings to. If blank, applies by default npcs : - 0 - 22 Item lines are also supported here. JobsReborn \ud83d\udd17 Requires adding the following to config.yml : hook : jobs : 'true' Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Can Level up: nujobs_canlevel {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Returns true if the player can level up Has Job: nujobs_hasjob {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Returns true if the player has this job Example nujobs_hasjob Woodcutter Job Full: nujobs_jobfull {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Returns true if the job is at the maximum slots Job Level: nujobs_joblevel {jobname} {min} {max} \ud83d\udd17 Returns true if the player has this job, and at a level equal to or between the min/max Example nujobs_joblevel Woodcutter 5 10 Events \ud83d\udd17 Add Jobs Experience: nujobs_addexp {jobname} {exp} \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player experience Increase Jobs Level: nujobs_addlevel {jobname} {amount} \ud83d\udd17 Increases the player level by amount. Decrease Jobs Level: nujobs_dellevel {jobname} {amount} \ud83d\udd17 Decreases the players level by amount. Join Jobs Job Event: nujobs_joinjob {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Joins the player to job. Leave Jobs Job Event: nujobs_leavejob {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Removes the player from job. Set Jobs Level: nujobs_setlevel {jobname} {level} \ud83d\udd17 Set the player to level. Objectives \ud83d\udd17 Join Jobs Job Objective: nujobs_joinjob {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Triggers when player joins job. Leave Jobs Job Objective: nujobs_leavejob {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Triggers when player leaves job. Notice This is not triggered by '/jobs leaveall' Jobs Job Levelup: nujobs_levelup {jobname} \ud83d\udd17 Triggers when player levels up. Jobs Job Payment: nujobs_payment {amount} \ud83d\udd17 Triggers when player makes {amount} of money from jobs. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of money already received, left is the amount of money still needed to receive and total is the amount of money initially required. LuckPerms \ud83d\udd17 Context Integration \ud83d\udd17 Any BetonQuest tag (global and per-player) can be used as a LuckPerms context. This means that a player needs the specified tag for a permission to be true - this removes the need for tons of permission add ... events as you can hook your existing quest progress tags right into LuckPerms permission contexts . The syntax is as follows: key value betonquest:tag:PACKAGE_NAME.TAG_NAME true betonquest:globaltag:PACKAGE_NAME.TAG_NAME true betonquest:tag:myPackage.tagName true betonquest:globaltag:myQuest.someTag true Check the Luck Perms documentation for an in-depth explanation on what contexts are and how to add them to permission. Magic \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Wand: wand \ud83d\udd17 This condition can check wands. The first argument is either hand , inventory or lost . If you choose lost , the condition will check if the player has lost a wand. If you choose hand , the condition will check if you're holding a wand in your hand. inventory will check your whole inventory instead of just the hand. In case of hand and inventory arguments you can also add optional name: argument followed by the name of the wand (as defined in wands.yml in Magic plugin) to check if it's the specific type of the wand. In the case of inventory you can specify an amount with amount and this will only return true if a player has that amount. You can also use optional spells: argument, followed by a list of spells separated with a comma. Each spell in this list can have defined minimal level required, after a colon. Example wand hand name:master spells:flare,missile:2 McMMO \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 McMMO Level: mcmmolevel \ud83d\udd17 This conditions checks if the player has high enough level in the specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill, second one is the minimum level the player needs to have to pass this condition. Example mcmmolevel woodcutting 50 Events \ud83d\udd17 Add MCMMO Experience: mcmmoexp \ud83d\udd17 This event adds experience points in a specified skill. The first argument is the name of the skill, second one is the amount of experience to add. Example mcmmoexp swords 1500 TeamRequiem ( MMOCore , MMOItem , MythicLib ) \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 MMOCore class: mmoclass \ud83d\udd17 Checks if a player has the given MMOCore class. You can check for any class that is not the default class by writing * instead of a class name. If a level has been specified the player needs to be on that level or higher to meet the condition. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument. 1 2 3 4 mmoclass * 5 mmoclass WARRIOR mmoclass MAGE 5 mmoclass MAGE 5 equal MMOCore attribute: mmoattribute \ud83d\udd17 Checks if a player has the specified attribute on the given level or higher. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument. 1 2 mmoclass mmoattribute strength 2 mmoclass mmoattribute strength 2 equal MMOCore profession: mmoprofession \ud83d\udd17 Checks if a player has the specified profession on the given level or higher. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument. 1 2 mmoprofession mining 2 mmoprofession mining 2 equal MMOItems item: mmoitem \ud83d\udd17 Checks if a player has the specified amount of MMOItems or more in his inventory. If no amount has been defined the default amount is one. 1 2 mmoitem ARMOR SKELETON_CROWN mmoitem GEMS SPEED_GEM 3 MMOItems hand: mmohand \ud83d\udd17 Checks if a player holds the specified MMOItem in his hand. Checks the main hand if not specified otherwise using the offhand argument. If no amount has been defined the default amount is one. 1 2 mmohand ARMOR SKELETON_CROWN mmohand GEMS SPEED_GEM 3 offhand MythicLib stat: mmostat \ud83d\udd17 Checks these stats that combine all sorts of stats from MMOCore and MMOItems. The player needs to be on the specified level or higher in order to meet this condition. You can disable this behaviour by adding the equal argument. 1 mmostat DAMAGE_REDUCTION 3 Objectives \ud83d\udd17 Break Special Blocks: mmocorebreakblock \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to break special blocks from MMOCore . All three different block types and an amount can be defined. You can also send notifications to the player by appending the notify keyword optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of blocks already broken, left is the amount of blocks still left to break and total is the amount of blocks initially required. 1 2 3 mmocorebreakblock 5 block:1 #A custom block's block ID mmocorebreakblock 64 block:STONE #vanilla material mmocorebreakblock 1 block:eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVy #... this is a heads texture data MMOCore Profession levelup: mmoprofessionlevelup \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to level the given profession to the specified level. 1 mmoprofessionlevelup MINING 10 Craft item: mmoitemcraft \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to craft the item with the given type and id. It supports any MMOItem that was crafted using vanilla crafting methods, MMOItems \"recipe-amounts\" crafting and MMOItems station crafting. An amount can also be set if it shall differ from the default (which is one) by adding the amount: argument. The amount is based on how many items have actually been crafted, not how often a specific recipe has been used! Therefore, a recipe that makes four items at once will let the objective progress by four steps. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of items already crafted, left is the amount of items still needed to craft and total is the amount of items initially required. 1 2 mmoitemcraft SWORD STEEL_SWORD mmoitemcraft HEALTH_POTION_RECIPE amount:5 Upgrade Item: mmoitemupgrade \ud83d\udd17 This objective tracks if a player upgrades the given item with an upgrade consumable. 1 mmoitemupgrade SWORD FALCON_BLADE Apply gemstone: mmoitemapplygem \ud83d\udd17 This objective is completed when the player applies the gemstone with the given gemstoneID to an item with the given itemType and itemID. 1 mmoitemapplygem SWORD CUTLASS GEM_OF_ACCURACY Cast item ability: mmoitemcastability \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to cast an ability using an item. The only argument is the abilityID. 1 mmoitemcastability LIFE_ENDER Cast class skill: mmocorecastskill \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to cast a class skill. The only argument is the abilityID. 1 mmocorecastskill BACKSTAB Events \ud83d\udd17 Give MMOCore class experience: mmoclassexperience \ud83d\udd17 Adds experience to the players class. The amount can be a variable or a number. The level argument is optional and would convert the amount to levels instead of XP points. 1 2 mmoclassexperience 150 mmoclassexperience 1 level Give MMOCore profession experience: mmoprofessionexperience \ud83d\udd17 Adds experience in the specified player profession. The amount can be a variable or a number. The level argument is optional and would convert the amount to levels instead of XP points. 1 2 mmoprofessionexperience 100 mmoprofessionexperience 1 level Give class points: mmocoreclasspoints \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player class points. The amount can be a variable or a number. 1 mmocoreclasspoints 1 Give skill points: mmocoreskillpoints \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player skill points. The amount can be a variable or a number. 1 mmocoreskillpoints 10 Give attribute points: mmocoreattributepoints \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player attribute points. The amount can be a variable or a number. 1 mmocoreattributepoints 2 Give attribute reallocation points: mmocoreattributereallocationpoints \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player attribute reallocation points. The amount can be a variable or a number. 1 mmocoreattributereallocationpoints 1 Give MMOItem: mmoitemgive \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player predefined item. Default amount is one and can be set manually to a higher amount or a variable. The item can be adjusted to the players level by adding the scale option. If you want all items to be stacked together the singleStack option can be set. If the player doesn't have required space in the inventory, the items will be dropped on the ground. You can also specify the notify keyword to display a message to the player about what items have been received. 1 mmoitemgive CONSUMABLE MANA_POTION Take MMOItem: mmoitemtake \ud83d\udd17 Removes the specified item from the players inventory. Optional arguments are an amount and notify to send a notification to the player. Which inventory types are checked is defined by the invOrder: option. You can use Backpack , Inventory and Armor there. One after another will be checked if multiple types are defined. The backpack will not work before 2.0's item rework since the current item system does not safe custom NBT data. You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about loosing items. Amount can be a variable. 1 2 3 4 5 mmoitemtake SWORD STEEL_SWORD mmoitemtake SWORD STEEL_SWORD notify mmoitemtake CONSUMABLE HEALTH_POTION amount:5 mmoitemtake CONSUMABLE BAKED_APPLES amount:2 invOrder:Backpack,Inventory mmoitemtake ARMOR KINGS_CHESTPLATE invOrder:Armor,Backpack MythicMobs \ud83d\udd17 Having MythicMobs allows you to use MythicMobs MobKill objective and MythicMobs SpawnMob event. Objectives \ud83d\udd17 MobKill: mmobkill \ud83d\udd17 You need to kill the specified amount of MythicMobs to complete this objective. The first argument must be the mob's internal name (the one defined in your MythicMobs configuration). You can optionally add the amount: argument to specify how many of these mobs need to be killed. It's also possible to add the optional arguments minLevel and maxLevel to further customize what mobs need to be killed. You can also add an optional neutralDeathRadiusAllPlayers argument to complete the objective for each nearby player within the defined radius when the mob is killed by any source. You can add a notify keyword if you want to send a notification to players whenever the objective progresses. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of mythic mobs already killed, left is the amount of mythic mobs still needed to kill and total is the amount of mythic mobs initially required. Example mmobkill SkeletalKnight amount:2 events:reward mmobkill SnekBoss amount:2 minlevel:4 maxlevel:6 events:reward Conditions \ud83d\udd17 MythicMob distance: mythicmobdistance \ud83d\udd17 Check whether the player is near a specific MythicMobs entity. The first argument is the internal name of the mob (the one defined in MythicMobs' configuration). The second argument is the distance to check, measured in block lengths in a circular radius. Example mythicmobdistance SkeletalKnight 7 Events \ud83d\udd17 SpawnMob: mspawnmob \ud83d\udd17 Spawn specified amount of MythicMobs at given location. The first argument is a location defined like 100;200;300;world . Second is MythicMobs internal name (the one defined in MythicMobs' configuration) followed by a colon and a level. Third one is amount and it's required! Example mspawnmob 100;200;300;world SkeletalKnight:1 5 PlaceholderAPI \ud83d\udd17 If you have this plugin, BetonQuest will add a betonquest placeholder to it and you will be able to use ph variable in your conversations. Placeholder: betonquest \ud83d\udd17 You can use all BetonQuest variables in any other plugin that supports PlaceholderAPI. You can even use BetonQuests conditions using the condition variable ! This works using the %betonquest_package:variable% placeholder. The package: part is the name of a package. If you don't specify this, the plugin will assume you're using that variable in default package. The variable part is just a BetonQuest variable without percentage characters, like point.beton.amount . Testing your placeholder is easy using this command: /papi parse <PlayerName> %betonquest_<PackageName>:<VariableType>.<Property>% 1 % betonquest_someGreatQuest:objective.killZombies.left% Variable: ph \ud83d\udd17 You can also use placeholders from other plugins in BetonQuest. Simply insert a variable starting with ph , the second argument should be the placeholder without percentage characters. Example % ph.player_item_in_hand% ProtocolLib \ud83d\udd17 Hiding NPC's \ud83d\udd17 Having ProtocolLib installed will let you hide Citizens NPCs if specified conditions are met. You can do that by adding a hide_npcs section to the custom.yml file in your package. It allows you to assign conditions to specific NPC IDs like so: hide_npcs : 41 : killedAlready,questStarted 127 : '!questStarted' The interval the conditions are checked in can be configured in the config.yml . Force Visibility update \ud83d\udd17 You can run the updatevisibility event to manually update the visibility. This is useful for performance optimizations on large servers if used together with the npc hider interval set to high values. Conversation IO: menu \ud83d\udd17 ProtocolLib also enables a conversation IO that makes use of a chat menu system. Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. Customize how it looks by adding the following lines to custom.yml: menu_conv_io : line_length : 50 refresh_delay : 180 npc_wrap : '&l &r' npc_text : '&l &r&f{npc_text}' npc_text_reset : '&f' option_wrap : '&r&l &l &l &l &r' option_text : '&l &l &l &l &r&8[ &b{option_text}&8 ]' option_text_reset : '&b' option_selected : '&l &r &r&7\u00bb&r &8[ &f&n{option_text}&8 ]' option_selected_reset : '&f' option_selected_wrap : '&r&l &l &l &l &r&f&n' control_select : jump,left_click control_cancel : sneak control_move : scroll,move npc_name_type : chat npc_name_align : center npc_name_format : '&e{npc_name}&r' Where: line_length - Maximum size of a line till its wrapped refresh_delay - Specify how many ticks to auto update display. Default 180 npc_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in the NPC text that wraps npc_text - How to write the NPC text. Replaces {1} with the npcs text npc_text_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in an option that wraps option_text - How to write an option. Replaces {1} with the option text option_text_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_selected - How to write a selected option. Replaces {1} with the option text option_selected_reset - When a color reset is found, what to replace it with option_selected_wrap - What text to prefix each new line in a selected option that wraps control_select - Space separated actions to select. Can be any of 'jump', 'left_click', 'sneak' control_cancel - Space separated actions to select. Can be any of 'jump', 'left_click', 'sneak' control_move - Space separated actions to move selection. Can be any of 'move', 'scroll' npc_name_type - Type of NPC name display. Can be one of: 'none', 'chat' npc_name_align - For npc name type of 'chat', how to align name. One of: 'left', 'right', 'center' npc_name_format - How to format the npc name Variables: {npc_text} - The text the NPC says {option_text} - The option text {npc_name} - The name of the NPC Chat Interceptor: packet \ud83d\udd17 Intercept pretty much anything sent to the player by intercepting packets sent to them. This can be enabled by default by setting the default_interceptor to packet in config.yml or per conversation by setting interceptor to packet in the top level of the conversation. Freeze players: 'freeze' \ud83d\udd17 This event allows you to freeze player for the given amount of ticks: freezeMe : \"freeze 100\" #Freezes the player for 5 seconds Quests \ud83d\udd17 Quests is another questing plugin, which offers very simple creation of quests. If you don't want to spend a lot of time to write advanced quests in BetonQuest but you need a specific thing from this plugin you can use Custom Event Reward or Custom Condition Requirement. Alternatively, if you have a lot of quests written in Quests, but want to integrate them with the conversation system, you can use quest event and quest condition. Condition Requirement (Quests) \ud83d\udd17 When adding requirements to a quest, choose \"Custom requirement\" and then select \"BetonQuest condition\". Now specify condition's name and it's package (like package.conditionName ). Quests will check BetonQuest condition when starting the quest. Event Reward (Quests) \ud83d\udd17 When adding rewards to a quest or a stage, choose \"Custom reward\" and then select \"BetonQuest event\". Now specify event's name and it's package (like package.eventName ). Quests will fire BetonQuest event when this reward will run. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Quest condition: quest \ud83d\udd17 This condition is met when the player has completed the specified quest. The first and only argument is the name of the quest. It it contains any spaces replace them with _ . Example quest stone_miner Events \ud83d\udd17 Quest: quest \ud83d\udd17 This event will start the quest for the player. The first argument must be the name of the quest, as defined in name option in the quest. If the name contains any spaces replace them with _ . You can optionally add check-requirements argument if you want the event to respect this quest's requirements (otherwise the quest will be forced to be started). Example quest stone_miner check-requirements Shopkeepers \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Shop amount: shopamount \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player owns specified (or greater) amount of shops. It doesn't matter what type these shops are. The only argument is a number - minimum amount of shops. Example shopamount 2 Events \ud83d\udd17 Open shop window: shopkeeper \ud83d\udd17 This event opens a trading window of a Villager. The only argument is the uniqueID of the shop. You can find it in Shopkeepers/saves.yml file, under uniqueID option. Example shopkeeper b687538e-14ce-4b77-ae9f-e83b12f0b929 SkillAPI \ud83d\udd17 This adds support for Sentropics SkillAPI fork . They still update SkillAPI. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 SkillAPI Class: skillapiclass \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player has specified class or a child class of the specified one. The first argument is simply the name of a class. You can add exact argument if you want to check for that exact class, without checking child classes. Example skillapiclass warrior SkillAPI Level: skillapilevel \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player has specified or greater level is the specified class. The first argument is class name, the second one is the required level. Example skillapilevel warrior 3 Skript \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest can also hook into Skript. Firstly, to avoid any confusion, I will refere to everything here by name of the plugin (Skript event is something else than BetonQuest event). Having Skript on your server will enable using BetonQuest events and conditions in scripts, and also trigger them by BetonQuest event. You can use cross-package paths using - between the packages. Example: player meets condition \"default-Forest-Jack.Completed\" Skript event triggered by BetonQuest skript event \ud83d\udd17 This entry will describe two things: Skript event and BetonQuest event. Skript event - on [betonquest] event \"id\" - this is the line you use in your scripts to trigger the code. betonquest part is optional, and id is just some string, which must be equal to the one you specified in BetonQuest event. BetonQuest event - skript - this event will trigger the above Skript event in your scripts. The instruction string accepts only one argument, id of the event. It have to be the same as the one defined in Skript event for it to be triggered. Example In your script on betonquest event \"concrete\" : In events.yml fire_concrete_script : skript concrete Skript condition \ud83d\udd17 You can check BetonQuest conditions in your scripts by using the syntax player meets [betonquest] condition \"id\" . betonquest is optional, and id is the name of the condition, as defined in conditions.yml . Example In your script player meets condition \"has_ore\" In conditions.yml has_ore : item iron_ore:5 Skript event \ud83d\udd17 You can also fire BetonQuest events with scripts. The syntax for Skript effect is fire [betonquest] event \"id\" for player . Everything else works just like in condition above. Example In your script fire event \"give_emeralds\" for player In events.yml give_emeralds : give emerald:5 Vault \ud83d\udd17 By installing Vault you enable Permission event and Money condition/event. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Vault Money Condition: money \ud83d\udd17 Checks if the player has specified amount of money. You can specify only one argument, amount integer. It cannot be negative! Example money 500 Events \ud83d\udd17 Vault Money Event: money \ud83d\udd17 Deposits, withdraws or multiplies money on player's account. There is only one argument, amount of money to modify. It can be positive, negative or start with an asterisk for multiplication. Example money -100 Permission: permission \ud83d\udd17 Adds or removes a permission or a group. First argument is add or remove . It's self-explanatory. Second is perm or group . It also shouldn't be hard to figure out. Next thing is actual string you want to add/remove. At the end you can also specify world in which you want these permissions. If the world name is ommited then permission/group will be global. Example permission remove group bandit world_nether Variables \ud83d\udd17 Vault Money Variable: money \ud83d\udd17 There is only one argument in this variable, amount for showing money amount or left: followed by a number for showing the difference between it and amount of money. Example % money.left:500% WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit \ud83d\udd17 Events \ud83d\udd17 Paste schematic: paste \ud83d\udd17 This event will paste a schematic at the given location. The first argument is a location and the second one is the name of schematic file. The file must be located in WorldEdit/schematics or FastAsyncWorldEdit/schematics and have a name like some_building.schematic . An optional noair can be added to paste ignoring air blocks. If you have only a .schem schematic, simply append .schem to the schematic name. Example paste 100;200;300;world some_building noair WorldGuard \ud83d\udd17 Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Inside Region: region \ud83d\udd17 This condition is met when the player is inside the specified region. The only argument is the name of the region. Example region beton Objectives \ud83d\udd17 Enter Region: region \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective you need to enter WorldGuard region with specified name. A required argument is the name of the region and you may also pass an optional entry and/or exit to only trigger when entering or exiting a region instead of anytime inside a region. Example region beton events:kill","title":"\ud83e\udd1d Compatibility List"},{"location":"Documentation/Compatibility/#compatibility","text":"In total 30 plugins have dedicated support for BetonQuest.

Valid directions are UP , DOWN , NORTH , EAST , WEST and SOUTH . Up and down start at a pitch of 60\u00b0. Example facing EAST Fly: fly \ud83d\udd17 This will check if the player is currently flying (Elytra type of flight). Example fly Game mode: gamemode \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player is in a specified game mode. The first argument is the game mode, i.e. survival, creative, adventure. Example gamemode survival Global point: globalpoint \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static The same as point condition but it checks the amount for a global point category which has the same value for all players. Example globalpoint global_knownusers 100 Global tag: globaltag \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This requires a specific global tag to be set and works the same as normal tag condition. Example globaltag global_areNPCsAgressive Item in Hand: hand \ud83d\udd17 This condition is met only when the player holds the specified quest item in their hand. The offhand will be checked instead of the main hand if the offhand keyword is added. Amount cannot be set here, though it may be checked with the item condition. Example hand SpecialSword hand QuestShield offhand Health: health \ud83d\udd17 Requires the player to have equal or more health than specified amount. The only argument is a number (double). Players can have 0 to 20 health by default (there are some plugins and commands which change the maximum) (0 means dead, don't use that since it will only be met when the player sees the red respawn screen). Example health 5.6 Height: height \ud83d\udd17 This condition requires the player to be below specific Y height. The required argument is a number or a location (for example 100;200;300;world). In case of location it will take the height from it and use it as regular height. Example height 16 Item in Inventory: item \ud83d\udd17 This condition requires the player to have all specified items in his inventory or backpack. You specify items in a list separated by commas (without spaces between!) Each item consists of its name and amount, separated by a colon. Amount is optional, so if you specify just item's name the plugin will assume there should be only one item. Example item emerald:5,gold:10 Journal entry: journal \ud83d\udd17 This condition will return true if the player has specified entry in his journal (internal name of the entry, like in journal.yml ). The only argument is name of the entry. Example journal wood_started Location: location \ud83d\udd17 It returns true only when the player is closer to specified location than the specified distance. Just two mandatory attributes - location and radius around it (can be a variable). Example location 100;200;300;survival_nether 5 Looking at a block: looking \ud83d\udd17 Checks if the player is looking at a block with the given location or material. You must specify either loc: optional (the location of the block) or type: optional as a block selector . You can also specify both. Example looking loc:12.0;14.0;-15.0;world type:STONE Moon Cycle: mooncycle \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks the players moon cycle (1 is full moon, 8 is Waxing Gibbous) and returns if the player is under that moon. A list of phases can be found here . Example mooncycle 1 Objective: objective \ud83d\udd17 This conditions is very simple: it's true only when the player has an active objective. The only argument is the name of the objective, as defined in objectives.yml . Example objective wood Alternative: or \ud83d\udd17 Alternative of specified conditions. This means that only one of conditions has to be met in order for alternative to be true. You just define one mandatory argument, condition names separated by commas. ! prefix works as always. Example or night,rain,!has_armor Partial date: partialdate \ud83d\udd17 The current date must match the given pattern. You can specify the day of the month, the month or the year it must be that this condition returns true or combine them. You can also specify multiple days/months/years by just separating them by , or a interval by using - . If you have trouble understanding how this works have a look at the example. The example is true between the 1 st and the 5 th or on the 20 th of each month, but only in the year 2017. Example partialdate day:1-5,20 year:2017 Party: party \ud83d\udd17 To see details about parties read \"Party\" chapter in Reference section. This condition takes three optional arguments: every: , any: and count: . \"Every\" is a list of conditions that must be met by every player in the party. Any is a list of conditions that must be met by at least one player in a party (it doesn't have to be the same player, one can meet first condition, another one can meet the rest and it will work). Count is just a number, minimal amount of players in the party. You don't have to specify all those arguments, you can use only one if you want. Example party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 every:some_item any:some_location,some_other_item count:5 Permission: permission \ud83d\udd17 The player must have a specified permission for this condition to be met. The instruction string must contain permission node as the required argument. Example permission essentials.tpa Point: point \ud83d\udd17 Requires the player to have amount of points equal to the specified category or more. There are two required arguments, first is the category (string), second is the amount (integer). You can also add optional argument equal to accept only players with exactly equal amount of points. Example point beton 20 Ride an entity: ride \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if the player rides the specified entity . any is also a valid input and matches any entity. Example ride horse ride any Random: random \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This condition is met randomly. There is one argument: two positive numbers like 5-12 . They mean something like that: \"It will be true 5 times out of 12\". Example random 12-100 Armor Rating: rating \ud83d\udd17 This one requires the player to wear armor which gives him specified amount of protection (armor icons). The first and only argument should be an integer. One armor point is equal to half armor icon in-game (10 means half of the bar filled). Example rating 10 Real time: realtime \ud83d\udd17 There must a specific (real) time for this condition to return true. You need to specify two times (formatted like hh:mm ) separated by dash. If the first is before the second the time must be between these two, if its after the second the time must be later than the first and earlier than the second to return true. Example realtime 8:00-12:30 Scoreboard: score \ud83d\udd17 With this condition you can check if the score in a specified objective on a scoreboard is greater or equal to specified amount. The first argument is the name of the objective, second one is amount (an integer). Example score kills 20 Sneaking: sneak \ud83d\udd17 Sneak condition is only true when the player is sneaking. This would probably be useful for creating traps, I'm not sure. There are no arguments for this one. Example sneak Tag: tag \ud83d\udd17 This one requires the player to have a specified tag. Together with ! negation it is one of the most powerful tools when creating conversations. The instruction string must contain tag name. Example tag quest_completed Test for block: testforblock \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This condition is met if the block at specified location matches the given material. First argument is a location, and the second one is a block selector . Example testforblock 100;200;300;world STONE Time: time \ud83d\udd17 There must be specific (Minecraft) time on the player's world for this condition to return true. You need to specify two hour numbers separated by dash. These number are normal 24-hour format hours. The first must be smaller than the second. If you want to achieve time period between 23 and 2 you need to negate the condition. Example time 2-23 Variable: variable \ud83d\udd17 This condition checks if a variable value matches given pattern . The first argument is a variable (with % characters). Second one is the pattern (for example, if you want to check if it's \"word\", the patter would simply be word , but if you want to check if it's a number (positive or negative) you would use -?\\d+ pattern - -? means a dash or no dash, \\d means any digit and + allows that digit to be repeated one or more times). Example variable %objective.var.price% -?\\d+ Weather: weather \ud83d\udd17 There must be a specific weather for this condition to return true. There are three possible options: sun, rain and storm. Note that /toggledownfall does not change the weather, it just does what the name suggests: toggles downfall. The rain toggled off will still be considered as rain! Use /weather clear instead. Example weather sun World: world \ud83d\udd17 This conditions checks if the player is in a specified world. The first argument is the name of a world.

All of its options are described on this page. There is also additional information about backups, updates and database transfers. If you fail to understand options just keep their default values. You can always change them when you have gained a more complete understanding of this plugin. Config Options \ud83d\udd17 Warning Do not touch version: option! It may corrupt your files! MySQL Database \ud83d\udd17 Setup \ud83d\udd17 In order to use a MySQL Database for saving all the data you need to fill out the mysql config section. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 mysql : enabled : true #Set this to true. host : '' #This is the IP of your MySQL server. If it runs on the same machine as your server use localhost or 127.0.0.1 port : '' #This is the port your MySQL server runs on. user : '' #The name of the database user that is used to connect to the database server. pass : '' #The password of that user. base : '' #The database that BetonQuest will write to. You need to create it in your database server. prefix : betonquest_ #The table prefix of BetonQuest's data in the database. Migrating a database from SQLite to MySQL and back \ud83d\udd17 Follow these few simple steps to migrate your database easily: Create a backup with /q backup command. Extract database backup from it. Turn the server off. Place the database-backup.yml file inside the plugin's directory. Edit which database type you want to use by setting the enabled option in the mysql section to true or false. Start the server. Check for errors. If there are no errors, enjoy your migrated database. If there are any errors, post them to the developer or try to fix them if you know how. Default Language \ud83d\udd17 language: is the default translation of the plugin for every new player. Currently, there are 9 languages available: English (en), Polish (pl), German (de), French (fr), Spanish (es), Chinese (cn), Dutch (nl), Italian (it) and Hungarian (hu). Updating \ud83d\udd17 The update section controls the Auto-Updater. It has the following settings: enabled (default true ). Enables or disables the Updater. If set to false, it is not possible to update with the updater and no version checks are executed. strategy (default MINOR ). The update strategy is the most important feature of the Auto-Updater. An explanation is available here . automatic (default true ). If true the updater will download new Versions automatically. Otherwise, the updater will only download new versions when the update command is executed. Journal slots \ud83d\udd17 default_journal_slot is the inventory slot in which the journal will appear after using the /journal command. BetonQuest will try to move items out of the way if the slot is occupied. If the inventory is full the journal will not be added. You can disable this behaviour by setting the option to -1 . BetonQuest will then just use any free slot. Citizens identifier \ud83d\udd17 citizens_npcs_by_name sets whether NPCs from Citizens 2 should be identified in main.yml by their name instead of their id. This is a dangerous setting as two different NPC's at the opposite edges of your world that share the same name by accident will trigger the same quest. Citizens left click \ud83d\udd17 acceptNPCLeftClick activates that a conversation with an NPC can also be started by left clicking the NPC and not only by right clicking the NPC. Citizens interact limit \ud83d\udd17 npcInteractionLimit prevents NPC / BetonQuest conversation click spamming. The time's unit is milliseconds. Default value: 500 Conversation End Distance \ud83d\udd17 max_npc_distance is the distance you need to walk away from the NPC for the conversation to end (in the case of using chat-based conversation interface). Default conversation style \ud83d\udd17 default_conversation_IO is a comma-separated list of conversation interfaces with the first valid one used. Read this page for more information about conversation interfaces. Default Chat interceptor \ud83d\udd17 default_interceptor is a comma-separated list of chat interceptors with the first valid one used. Read this page for more information about chat interceptors. Conversation Chat Display options \ud83d\udd17 display_chat_after_conversation this will prevent all chat messages from displaying during a conversation and it will show them once it's finished. Combat Delay \ud83d\udd17 combat_delay is a delay (in seconds) the player must wait before starting a conversation after combat. Conversation pullback message \ud83d\udd17 notify_pullback will display a message every time the player is pulled back by the stop option in conversations (in the case of chat-based conversations). It notifies players that they are in a conversation, and the pullback is not a bug. Default Package name \ud83d\udd17 default_package is a name of the package that should be used when a package is not specified in /q command. This is for your convenience. Adjusting the backpack to the KeepInventory gamerule \ud83d\udd17 remove_items_after_respawn option should be turned on if \"keepInventory\" gamerule is not being used. It prevents other plugins from duplicating quest items after death. When a player dies, their quest items are removed from drops and stored in the backpack, but some plugins may try to restore all items to the player (for example WorldGuard custom flag keep-inventory). That is why BetonQuest removes the quest items that are in a player's inventory after they respawn again, to be sure they were not readded. The \"keepInventory\" gamerule, however, works differently - the items are never dropped, so they cannot be added to backpack. Removing them from the inventory would destroy them forever. Sadly, Bukkit does not allow for gamerule checking, so it is up to you to decide. Once again, if you have \"keepInventory\" gamerule true, this setting has to be false and vice versa. Quest Items break behaviour \ud83d\udd17 quest_items_unbreakable controls whether quest items can be broken by using them. This was used in the past when the unbreakable tag couldn't be added to items. Turn it off and make your quest items unbreakable by vanilla means. Player Hider interval \ud83d\udd17 player_hider_check_interval the interval in which the PlayerHider checks the conditions and updates the player's visibility. Cannot be disabled currently. If you want this to be semi-disabled set a very high value. NPC Hider interval \ud83d\udd17 npc_hider_check_interval is the interval in which the NPCHider checks the conditions and updates the NPC's visibility. Cannot be disabled currently. If you want this to be semi-disabled set a very high value. Sounds \ud83d\udd17 This section defines what sounds will be played on these occasions: start and end refer to start and end points of conversations. journal is played upon updating the journal. update is played when there is a changelog file, used to draw your attention. full is played when the player executes /journal but his inventory is full. A list of all possible sounds for the latest Minecraft version can be found here . Conversation Command Banlist \ud83d\udd17 cmd_blacklist is a list of commands that cannot be used during a conversation. Remember that you can only type single words (command names) here! Compatibility Hooks \ud83d\udd17 hook controls compatibility with other plugins. You can turn off each hook here. Journal \ud83d\udd17 journal controls various settings of the journal: chars_per_page is the number of characters before a page break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This was replaced by chars_per_line and lines_per_page and is only required if you don't like the new behaviour. chars_per_line is the number of characters before a line break. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. If this is not set, BQ will fall back on the old page wrapping behaviour configured through chars_per_page . lines_per_page is the number of lines before a new page. If it is set too high, the text on a journal page can overflow and become invisible. This is only required if chars_per_line is set. one_entry_per_page makes each entry take a single page. Note that it will not expand to other pages even if it overflows, so keep your entries short. reversed_order controls the chronological order of entries in the journal. By default, the entries are ordered from newest to oldest. It is reversible, but this will force players to click through many pages to get to the most recent entry. hide_date hides the date of each entry. Set it to true if you don't want this functionality. full_main_page makes the main page always take a full page. If a lot of information is being displayed, it is advised to make this true. If you use the main page only for small notifications, set it to false, so the entries can follow immediately. show_separator shows a separator between journal entries (default: true).

If you want to write ' character, you must double it and surround the whole text with another ' characters. When writing true or false it also needs to be surrounded with ' . If you want to start the line with & character, the whole line needs to be surrounded with ' . You can check if the file is correct using this tool . quester is name of NPC. It should be the same as name of NPC this conversation is assigned to for greater immersion, but it's your call. first are pointers to options the NPC will use at the beginning of the conversation. He will choose the first one that meets all conditions. You define these options in npc_options branch. final_events are events that will fire on conversation end, no matter how it ends (so you can create e.g. guards attacking the player if he tries to run). You can leave this option out if you don't need any final events. stop determines if player can move away from an NPC while in this conversation (false) or if he's stopped every time he tries to (true). If enabled, it will also suspend the conversation when the player quits, and resume it after he joins back in. This way he will have to finish his conversation no matter what. It needs to be in '' ! You can modify the distance at which the conversation is ended / player is moved back with max_npc_distance option in the config.yml . interceptor optionally set a chat interceptor for this conversation. Multiple interceptors can be provided in a comma-separated list with the first valid one used. NPC_options is a branch with texts said by the NPC. player_options is a branch with options the player can choose. text defines what will display on screen. If you don't want to set any events/conditions/pointers to the option, just skip them. Only text is always required. conditions are names of conditions which must be met for this option to display, separated by commas. events is a list of events that will fire when an option is chosen (either by NPC or a player), defined similarly to conditions. pointer is list of pointers to the opposite branch (from NPC branch it will point to options player can choose from when answering, and from player branch it will point to different NPC reactions). When an NPC wants to say something he will check conditions for the first option (in this case option1 ). If they are met, he will choose it. Otherwise, he will skip to next option (note: conversation ends when there are no options left to choose). After choosing an option NPC will execute any events defined in it, say it, and then the player will see options defined in player_options branch to which pointers setting points, in this case reply1 and reply2 . If the conditions for the player option are not met, the option is simply not displayed, similar to texts from NPC. Player will choose option he wants, and it will point back to other NPC text, which points to next player options and so on. If there are no possible options for player or NPC (either from not meeting any conditions or being not defined) the conversations ends. If the conversation ends unexpectedly, check the console - it could be an error in the configuration. This can and will be a little confusing, so you should name your options, conditions and events in a way which you will understand in the future. Don't worry though, if you make some mistake in configuration, the plugin will tell you this in console when testing a conversation. Also, study the default conversation included with the plugin to fully understand how powerful this system can be. Cross-conversation pointers \ud83d\udd17 If you want to create a conversation with multiple NPCs at once or split a huge conversation into smaller, more focused files, you can point to NPC options in other conversations. Just type the pointer as conversation.npc_option . Keep in mind that you can only cross-point to NPC options. It means that you can use those pointers only in first starting options and in all player options. Using them in NPC options will throw errors. Warning This does not work across packages yet. Conversation variables \ud83d\udd17 You can use variables in the conversations. They will be resolved and displayed to the player when he starts a conversation. A variable generally looks like that: %type.optional.arguments% . Type is a mandatory argument, it defines what kind of variable it is. Optional arguments depend on the type of the variable, i.e. %npc% does not have any additional arguments, but %player% can also have display (it will look like that: %player.display% ). You can find a list of all available variable types in the \"Variables List\" chapter. Note If you use a variable incorrectly (for example trying to get a property of an objective which isn't active for the player, or using %npc% in message event), the variable will be replaced with empty string (\"\"). Translations \ud83d\udd17 As you can see in default conversation, there are additional messages in other languages. That's because you can translate your conversations into multiple languages. The players will be albe to choose their preferred one with /questlang command. You can translate every NPC/player option and quester's name. You do this like this: quester : en : Innkeeper pl : Karczmarz de : Gastwirt As said before, the same rule applies to all options and quester's name. The player can choose only from languages present in messages.yml , and if there will be no translation to this language in the conversation, the plugin will fall back to the default language, as defined in config.yml . If that one is not defined, there will be an error. You can also translate journal entries, quest cancelers and message events, more about that later. Conversation displaying \ud83d\udd17 BetonQuest provides different conversation styles, so called \"conversationIO's\". They all look different but the biggest difference is the way the user interacts with them. menu A modern conversation style that works with some of Minecraft's native controls. All options can be found in the compatibility section. This is a video of it in action: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. All options can be found in the compatibility section. simple A chat output. The user has to write a number into their chat to select an option. tellraw Also a chat output. The user can click on the options instead of typing them. slowtellraw The same as tellraw but the NPC's text is printed line by line, delayed by 0.5 seconds. chest A chest GUI with clickable buttons where the NPC's text and options will be shown as item lore. You can change the option's item to something else than ender pearls by adding a prefix to that option's text. The prefix is a name of the material (like in items.yml ) inside curly braces, with an optional damage value after a colon. Example of such option text: {diamond_sword}I want to start a quest! . You can control the colors of conversation elements in the config.yml file, in conversation_colors section. Here you must use names of the colors. BetonQuest uses the menu conversationIO by default. If ProtocolLib is not installed, the chest IO will be used. You can however change the utilized conversationIO by setting the default_conversation_IO option in the config.yml file. In case you want to use a different type of conversation display for just one specific conversation you can add a conversationIO: <type> setting to the conversation file at the top of the YAML hierarchy (which is the same level as quester or first options). Chat Interceptors \ud83d\udd17 While engaged in a conversation, it can be distracting when messages from other players or system messages interfere with the dialogue. A chat interceptor provides a method of intercepting those messages and then sending them after the conversation has ended. You can specify the default chat interceptor by setting default_interceptor inside the config.yml . Additionally, you can overwrite the default for each conversation by setting the interceptor key inside your conversation file. The default configuration of BetonQuest sets the default_interceptor option to packet,simple . This means that it first tries to use the packet interceptor. If that fails it falls back to using the simple interceptor. BetonQuest adds following interceptors: simple , packet and none : The simple interceptor works with every Spigot server but only supports very basic functionality and may not work with plugins like Herochat. The packet interceptor requires the ProtocolLib plugin to be installed. It will work well in any kind of situation. The none interceptor is an interceptor that won't intercept messages. That sounds useless until you have a conversation that you want to be excluded from interception. In this case you can just set interceptor: none inside your conversation file. Advanced: Extends \ud83d\udd17 Conversation also supports the concept of inheritance. Any option can include the key extends with a comma delimited list of other options of the same time. The first option that does not have any false conditions will have it's text, pointers and events merged with the extending option. The extended option may itself extend other options. Infinite loops are detected. NPC_options : ## Normal Conversation Start start : text : 'What can I do for you' extends : tonight, today ## Useless addition as example tonight : # Always false condition : random 0-1 text : ' tonight?' extends : main_menu today : text : ' today?' extends : main_menu ## Main main_menu main_menu : pointers : i_have_questions, bye In the above example, the option start is extended by both tonight and today , both of whom are extended by main_menu . As tonight has a false condition the today option will win. The start option will have the pointers in main_menu added to it just as if they were defined directly in it and the text will be joined together from today . If you structure your conversation correctly you can make use of this to minimize duplication.","title":"\ud83d\udcac \u200aConversations"},{"location":"Documentation/Conversations/#general-information","text":"Each conversation must define name of the NPC (some conversations can be not bound to any NPC, so it\u2019s important to specify it even though an NPC will have a name) and his initial options. quester : Name first : option1, option2 stop : 'true' final_events : event1, event2 interceptor : simple NPC_options : option1 : text : Some text in default language events : event3, event4 conditions : condition1, !condition2 pointers : reply1, reply2 option2 : text : '&3This ends the conversation' player_options : reply1 : text : en : Text in English pl : Tekst po polsku event : event5 condition : '!condition3' pointer : option2 reply2 : text : 'Text containing '' character' Note Configuration files use YAML syntax.

The packet interceptor requires the ProtocolLib plugin to be installed. It will work well in any kind of situation. The none interceptor is an interceptor that won't intercept messages. That sounds useless until you have a conversation that you want to be excluded from interception. In this case you can just set interceptor: none inside your conversation file.","title":"Chat Interceptors"},{"location":"Documentation/Conversations/#advanced-extends","text":"Conversation also supports the concept of inheritance. Any option can include the key extends with a comma delimited list of other options of the same time. The first option that does not have any false conditions will have it's text, pointers and events merged with the extending option. The extended option may itself extend other options. Infinite loops are detected. NPC_options : ## Normal Conversation Start start : text : 'What can I do for you' extends : tonight, today ## Useless addition as example tonight : # Always false condition : random 0-1 text : ' tonight?' extends : main_menu today : text : ' today?' extends : main_menu ## Main main_menu main_menu : pointers : i_have_questions, bye In the above example, the option start is extended by both tonight and today , both of whom are extended by main_menu . As tonight has a false condition the today option will win. The start option will have the pointers in main_menu added to it just as if they were defined directly in it and the text will be joined together from today . If you structure your conversation correctly you can make use of this to minimize duplication.","title":"Advanced: Extends"},{"location":"Documentation/Events-List/","text":"Events List \ud83d\udd17 Cancel quest: cancel \ud83d\udd17 This event works in the same way as a quest canceler in the backpack . Running it is equal to the player clicking on the bone. The only argument is a name of a quest canceler, as defined in main.yml Example cancel wood Chat player message chat \ud83d\udd17 This event will send the given message as the player. Therefore, it will look like as if the player did send the message. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can only use %player% as a variable in this event. Additional messages can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . If a plugin does not work with the sudo / command event you need to use this event. Example sendMSG : \"chat Hello!\" sendMultipleMSGs : \"chat Hi %player%|ban %player%|pardon %player%\" sendPluginCommand : \"chat /someCommand x y z\" Chest Clear: chestclear \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event removes all items from a chest at specified location. The only argument is a location. Example chestclear 100;200;300;world Chest Give: chestgive \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This works the same as give event, but it puts the items in a chest at specified location. The first argument is a location, the second argument is a list of items, like in give event. If the chest is full, the items will be dropped on the ground. The chest can be any other block with inventory, i.e. a hopper or a dispenser. BetonQuest will log an error to the console when this event is fired but there is no chest at specified location. Example chestgive 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword Chest Take: chesttake \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event works the same as take event, but it takes items from a chest at specified location. The instruction string is defined in the same way as in chestgive event. Example chesttake 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword Clear entities: clear \ud83d\udd17 This event removes all specified mobs from the specified area. The first required argument is a list of mobs (taken from here ) separated by commas. Next is location. After that there is the radius around the location (a positive number or a variable). You can also optionally specify name: argument, followed by name which removed mobs must have. You can use marked: argument to remove only mobs marked in spawn event. Example clear ZOMBIE,CREEPER 100;200;300;world 10 name:Monster Compass: compass \ud83d\udd17 When you run this event, you can add or remove a compass destination for the player. You may also directly set the players's compass destination as well. When a destination is added the player will be able to select a specified location as a target of his compass. To select the target the player must open his backpack and click on the compass icon. The first argument is add , del or set , and second one is the name of the target, as defined in main.yml . Note that if you set a target the player will not automatically have it added to their choices. The destination must be defined in the main.yml file in compass section. You can specify a name for the target in each language or just give a general name, and optionally add a custom item (from items.yml ) to be displayed in the backpack. Example of a compass target: compass : beton : name : en : Target pl : Cel location : 100;200;300;world item : scroll Example compass add beton Command: command \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Runs specified command from the console. The instruction string is the command, without leading slash. You can use variables here, but variables other than %player% won't resolve if the event is fired from delayed folder and the player is offline now. You can define additional commands by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the command use \\| . Looking for run command as player ? Example command kill %player%|ban %player% Conversation: conversation \ud83d\udd17 Starts a conversation at location of the player. The only argument is ID of the conversation. This bypasses the conversation permission! Example conversation village_smith Damage player: damage \ud83d\udd17 Damages the player by specified amount of damage. The only argument is a number (can have floating point). Example damage 20 Delete Point: deletepoint \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Delete the player points in a specified category. Example deletepoint npc_attitude Door: door \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event can open and close doors, trapdoors and fence gates. The syntax is exactly the same as in lever event above. Example door 100;200;300;world off Remove Potion Effect: deleffect \ud83d\udd17 Removes the specified potion effects from the player. Use any instead of a list of types to remove all potion effects from the player. Example deleffect ABSORPTION,BLINDNESS Potion Effect: effect \ud83d\udd17 Adds a specified potion effect to player. First argument is potion type. You can find all available types here . Second is integer defining how long the effect will last in seconds. Third argument, also integer, defines level of the effect (1 means first level). Add a parameter ambient to make potion particles appear more invisible (just like beacon effects). To hide particles add a parameter hidden . To hide the icon for the effect add noicon . Example effect BLINDNESS 30 1 ambient icon Explosion: explosion \ud83d\udd17 static Creates an explosion. It can make fire and destroy blocks. You can also define power, so be careful not to blow your server away. Default TNT power is 4, while Wither on creation is 7. First argument can be 0 or 1 and states if explosion will generate fire (like Ghast\u2019s fireball). Second is also 0 or 1 but this defines if block will be destroyed or not. Third argument is the power (float number). At the end (4 th attribute) there is location. Example explosion 0 1 4 100;64;-100;survival Folder: folder \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static It's something like a container for multiple events. You can use it to clarify your code. It also features optional delay and period measured in seconds (you can use ticks or minutes if you add ticks or minutes argument). It is persistent for events marked as persistent , which means that the events will be fired even after the player logs out. Beware though, all conditions are false when the player is offline (even inverted ones), so those events should not be blocked by any conditions! The only required argument is a list of events separated by commas. There are also three optional arguments: delay: , period: and random: . Delay and Period is a number of seconds. Delay is the time before execution and period is the time between each event. It's optional and leaving it blank is the same as delay:0 or period:0 . Random is the amount of events, that will be randomly chosen to fire. It's optional and leaving it blank or omit it will fire all events. Example folder event1,event2,event3 delay:5 period:5 random:1 Give Items: give \ud83d\udd17 Gives the player predefined items. They are specified exactly as in item condition - list separated by commas, every item can have amount separated by colon. Default amount is 1. If the player doesn't have required space in the inventory, the items are dropped on the ground, unless they are quest items. Then they will be put into the backpack. You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about receiving items. Example give emerald:5,emerald_block:9 Give journal: givejournal \ud83d\udd17 This event simply gives the player his journal. It acts the same way as /j command would. Example givejournal Global point: globalpoint \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This works the same way as the normal point event but instead to manipulating the points for a category of a specific player it manipulates points in a global category. These global categories are player independent, so you could for example add a point to such a global category every time a player does a quest and give some special rewards for the 100 th player who does the quest. Example globalpoint global_knownusers 1 Global tag: globaltag \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Works the same way as a normal tag event, but instead of setting a tag for one player it sets it globaly for all players. Example globaltag add global_areNPCsAgressive If else: if \ud83d\udd17 This event will check a condition, and based on the outcome it will run the first or second event. The instruction string is if condition event1 else event2 , where condition is a condition ID and event1 and event2 are event IDs. else keyword is mandatory between events for no practical reason. Example if sun rain else sun Journal: journal \ud83d\udd17 static Adds or deletes an entry to/from a player's journal. Journal entries have to be defined in journal.yml . The first argument is the action to perform, the second one is the name of the entry if required. Changing journal entries will also reload the journal. Possible actions are: - add : Adds a page to the journal. - delete : Deletes a page from the journal. - update : Refreshes the journal. This is especially useful when you need to update the main page. Example journal add quest_started journal delete quest_available journal update Kill: kill \ud83d\udd17 Kills the player. Nothing else. Kill Mobs: killmob \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Kills all mobs of given type at the location. First argument is the type of the mob . Next argument is the location. Third argument is the radius around the location, in which the mobs must be to get killed. You can also specify name: argument, followed by the name of the mob which should get killed. All _ characters will be replaced with spaces. If you want to kill only mobs that have been marked using the spawn mob event use marked: argument followed by the keyword. Only mobs that are in loaded chunks can be killed by using this event. Example killmob ZOMBIE 100;200;300;world 40 name:Bolec Language Event: language \ud83d\udd17 This event changes player's language to the specified one. There is only one argument, the language name. Example language en Lever: lever \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event can switch a lever. The first argument is a location and the second one is state: on , off or toggle . Example lever 100;200;300;world toggle Lightning: lightning \ud83d\udd17 static Strikes a lightning at given location. The only argument is the location. Example lightning 100;64;-100;survival Notification: notify \ud83d\udd17 Displays a notification using the NotifyIO system. Warning All colons ( : ) in the message part of the notification need to be escaped, including those inside variables. One backslash ( \\ ) is required when using no quoting at all ( ... ) or single quotes ( '...' ). Two backslashes are required ( \\\\ ) when using double quotes ( \"...\" ). Examples: eventName: notify Peter:Heya %player%! eventName: notify Peter \\ :Heya %player%! eventName: ' notify Peter:Heya %player%! ' eventName: ' notify Peter \\ :Heya %player%! ' eventName: \" notify Peter:Heya %player%! \" eventName: \" notify Peter \\\\ :Heya %player%! \" otherEvent: notify You own %math.calc:5% fish! otherEvent: You own %math.calc \\ :5% fish! Option Description message The message that will be displayed. Supports variables and translations. Required, must be first category Will load all settings from that Notification Category. Can be a comma-seperated list. The first existent category will be used. Optional io Any NotifyIO . Overrides the \"category\" settings. Optional NotifyIO Any setting from the defined notifyIO. Can be used multiple times. Overrides the \"category\" settings. Optional The fallback NotifyIO is chat if no argument other than message is specified. message is the only argument of this event that is not key:value based. You can freely add any text with spaces there. It also allows you to provide multiple translations using a special syntax: example : \"notify {en} ABC {de} DEF\" The value in {} is a language key from messages.yml. Any text after the language key until the next language key belongs to the specified language. There must be a space between the language key and the message. In this example, english users would see ABC and german ones would see DEF . Examples: Check out the documentation about Notify Categories and Notify IO options if you haven't yet. You must understand these two if you want to use the Notify system to it's full extend. #The simplest of all notify events. Just a chat message: customEvent : \"notify Hello %player%!\" #It's the same as this one since 'chat' is the default IO. theSame : \"notify Hello %player%! io:chat\" #This one displays a title and a subtile: myTitle : \"notify This is a title.\\nThis is a subtitle. io:title\" #Plays a sound: mySound : \"notify io:sound sound:x.y.z\" #This one explicitly defines an io (bossbar) and adds one bossbarIO option + one soundIO option: myBar : \"notify This is a custom message. io:bossbar barColor:red sound:block.anvil.use\" #Some events with categories. myEvent1 : \"notify This is a custom message! category:info\" myEvent2 : \"notify This is a custom message! category:firstChoice,secondChoice\" #You can also override category settings: myEvent3 : \"notify Another message! category:info io:advancement frame:challenge\" #Use multiple languages: multilanguage : \"notify {en} Hello english person! {de} Hello german person! {es} Hello spanish person!\" Broadcast: notifyall \ud83d\udd17 This events works just like the notify event but shows the notification for all online players. Objective: objective \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Manages the objectives. Syntax is objective <action> name , where <action> can be start / add (one of the two), delete / remove or complete / finish . Name is the name of the objective, as defined in objectives.yml . Using this in static contexts only works when removing objectives! Example objective start wood OPsudo: opsudo \ud83d\udd17 This event is similar to the sudo event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player with temporary OP permissions. Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . Looking for run as normal player ? Looking for console commands ? Example opsudo spawn Party event: party \ud83d\udd17 Runs the specified list of events (third argument) for every player in a party. More info about parties in \"Party\" chapter in Reference section. Example party 10 has_tag1,!has_tag2 give_reward Pick random: pickrandom \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Another container for events. It picks one (or multiple) of the given events and runs it. You must specify how likely it is that each event is picked by adding the percentage before the event's id. The event won't break if your total percentages are above 100%. It picks one event from the list by default, but you can add an optional amount: if you want more to be picked. Note that only as many events as specified can be picked and amount:0 will do nothing. There must be two %% before the event's name if variables are used, one is from the variable and the other one from the event's syntax. Example pickrandom 20.5%event1,0.5%event2,79%event3 amount:2 pickrandom %point.factionXP.amount%%event1,0.5%event2,79%event3,1%event4 amount:3 Point: point \ud83d\udd17 persistent Gives the player a specified amount of points in a specified category. Amount can be negative if you want to subtract points. You can also use an asterisk to do multiplication (or division, if you use a fraction). First argument after the event name must be a category, and the second one - amount of points to give/take/multiply. This event also supports an optional notify argument that will display information about the change using the notification system. Example point npc_attitude 10 Example point village_reputation *0.75 Run events: run \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event allows you to specify multiple instructions in one, long instruction. Each instruction must be started with the ^ character (it divides all the instructions). It's not the same as the folder event, because you have to specify the actual instruction, not an event name. It is also fired on the same tick, not on the next one like in folder . Don't use conditions here, it behaves strangely. We will fix this in 2.0. Example run ^tag add beton ^give emerald:5 ^entry add beton ^kill Scoreboard: score \ud83d\udd17 This event works in the same way as point event, the only difference is that is uses scoreboards instead of points. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide scores in objectives on the scoreboard. The first argument is the name of the objective, second one is a number. It can be positive for additon, negative for subtraction or prefixed with an asterisk for multiplication. Multiplying by fractions is the same as dividing. Example score kills 1 Set Block: setblock \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Changes the block at the given position. The first argument is a Block Selector , the second a location. Very powerful if used to trigger redstone contraptions. Example setblock REDSTONE_BLOCK 100;200;300;world Spawn Mob: spawn \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static Spawns specified amount of mobs of given type at the location. First argument is a location. Next is type of the mob . The last, third argument is integer for amount of mobs to be spawned. You can also specify name: argument, followed by the name of the mob. All _ characters will be replaced with spaces. You can also mark the spawned mob with a keyword using marked: argument. It won't show anywhere, and you can check for only marked mobs in mobkill objective. You can specify armor which the mob will wear and items it will hold with h: (helmet), c: (chestplate), l: (leggings), b: (boots), m: (main hand) and o: (off hand) optional arguments. These take a single item without amount, as defined in items.yml . You can also add a list of drops with drops: argument, followed by a list of items with amounts after colons, separated by commas. Example spawn 100;200;300;world SKELETON 5 marked:targets Example spawn 100;200;300;world ZOMBIE name:Bolec 1 h:blue_hat c:red_vest drops:emerald:10,bread:2 Sudo: sudo \ud83d\udd17 This event is similar to command event, the only difference is that it will fire a command as the player (often referred to as player commands). Additional commands can be defined by separating them with | character. If you want to use a | character in the message use \\| . Looking for run as op ? Looking for console commands ? Example sudo spawn Tag: tag \ud83d\udd17 persistent , static This event adds (or removes) a tag to the player. The first argument after event's name must be add or del . Next goes the tag name. It can't contain spaces (though _ is fine). Additional tags can be added, separated by commas (without spaces). Example tag add quest_started,new_entry Take Items: take \ud83d\udd17 Removes items from the player\u2019s inventory, armor slots or backpack. The items itself must be defined in the items.yml, optionally with an amount after a colon. Which inventory types are checked is defined by the invOrder: option. You can use Backpack , Inventory , Offhand and Armor there. One after another will be checked if multiple types are defined. Note: If the items aren't quest items don't use take event with player options in conversations! The player can drop items before selecting the option and pickup them after the event fires. Validate it on the NPC\u2019s reaction! You can also specify notify keyword to display a simple message to the player about loosing items. Example take emerald:120,sword take nugget:6 notify take wand notify invOrder:Backpack take money:50 invOrder:Backpack,Inventory take armor invOrder:Armor,Offhand,Inventory,Backpack Time: time \ud83d\udd17 Sets or adds time. The only argument is time to be set (integer) or time to be added (integer prefixed with +), in 24 hours format. Subtracting time is done by adding more time (if you think of this, it actually makes sense). Minutes can be achieved with floating point. Example time +6 Teleport: teleport \ud83d\udd17 Teleports the player to a specified location, with or without head rotation. It will also end the conversation, if the player has one active.The first and only argument must be location. It's a good idea to use yaw and pitch here. Example teleport 123;32;-789;world_the_nether;180;45 Variable: variable \ud83d\udd17 This event has only one purpose: Change values that are stored in variable objective variables. The first argument is the ID of the variable objective. The second argument is the name of the variable to set. The third argument is the value to set. Both the name and value can use %...% variables. To delete a variable you can use \"\" . Refer to the variable objective documentation for more information about storing variables. Example variable some_var_obj name %player% variable other_var_obj desc \"\" Weather: weather \ud83d\udd17 Sets weather. The argument is sun , rain or storm . Example weather rain Give experience: experience \ud83d\udd17 Gives the specified amount of experience points to the player. You can give whole levels by adding the level argument.

Number : The location the sound will be played at is moved away from the player towards the soundlocation using the value of soundplayeroffset . The sound will be at the actual location if the player is closer to the soundlocation then the soundplayeroffset would allow. Visual Explanation This shows how the sound will be played at the soundlocation if the soundplayeroffset is bigger then the current distance between the player and the soundlocation Example usage : You could make a \"sound compass\" that will play a sound in the direction of a point of interest. Vector : A vector has to be in the format (x;y;z) . This system will use the players relative coordinate system. This means that the vectors x axis is right / left from the players head, the y axis is up or down from where ever the players face is and the z axis is before / behind the players face. It will move along the players head. Visual Explanation In contrast to their global counterparts, relative x,y,z axes do not change their orientation relative to the player. Example: The positive x-axis will always point left from the perspective of the player. This makes it possible to go crazy with sounds.

For example: When BetonQuest fails to add a quest item to a player's inventory it will send &e*&bYour inventory is full!&e* . This message is defined in messages.yml along with other default plugin messages. You can redefine them to your liking. The Notify System can do much more than just changing messages though: All notifications will be displayed using the ChatIO and without a sound by default. You need to use notification categories to change this behaviour. These categories are pretty much just pre-defined NotifyIO settings . Each notification in messages.yml has a special category with a reserved name assigned to it. For example: If you would like to have the \"language_changed\" notification displayed as an actionbar message you would: Add a file named custom.yml to your package. Add this to the file: notifications : #General header for all notification settings language_changed : #Name of the category, same as in messages.yml io : actionbar #Setting the Notify IO to \"actionbar\" Warning A note about the custom.yml: This is a strange file. BetonQuest searches through all packages and just uses the first one it finds. Therefore, you should probably create just one custom.yml with all your settings. We will improve this in BQ 2.0. You can add any other Notify IO setting to the category like so: notifications : language_changed : io : actionbar sound : entity.blaze.hurt #Plays a sound while showing the notification changelog : #This is another category. They all need to be inside the 'notifications:' section. sound : entity.experience_orb.pickup A full list of all reserved names can be found on the IO's & Categories page. This feature can be used to disable build-in notifications: Just set io: to supress for any notification that you want to remove. Objective notifications \ud83d\udd17 Some objectives have a notify argument that can be added to their instruction. If you do so, the objective will send a notification to the player if they progress in the objective. You can also add an intervall ( notify:5 ) - in this case the player will get a notification every 5 steps towards the completion of the objective. The messages.yml values of these notifications look a bit strange: blocks_to_break : '&2{1} blocks left to break' {1} is just an internal variable (similar to the color codes) that will be replaced with a number based on the player's progression. You can customize how these notifications are displayed using exactly the same method as for other built-in notifications.","title":"\ud83d\udd0a \u200a\u200aSettings"},{"location":"Documentation/Notification-Settings/#sending-custom-notifications","text":"A truly custom notification can be sent using the notify event at any time.

The first argument is the type of the click, it can be right, left or any. Next is a Block Selector or any if you want to count all clicks, even into the air. You can also specify the loc: argument, followed by the standard location format and the range: followed by a number (or variable). The specified location is the center of a sphere, the range it's radius. Therefore, these arguments define where the clicked block needs to be, as opposed to \"where you must be\" in location condition. If you add the argument cancel , the click will be canceled (chest will not open, button will not be pressed etc.). This objective works great with the location condition and the item in hand condition to further limit the counted clicks. One could make a magic wand using this. The objective contains one property, location . It's a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . It does not show the radius. Example action right DOOR conditions:holding_key loc:100;200;300;world range:5 action any any conditions:holding_magicWand events:fireSpell #Custom click listener for a wand Arrow Shooting: arrow \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player needs to shoot the arrow into the target. There are two arguments, location of the target and precision number (radius around location where the arrow must land, should be small). Note that the position of an arrow after hit is on the wall of a full block, which means that shooting not full blocks (like heads) won't give accurate results. Experiment with this objective a bit to make sure you've set the numbers correctly. Example arrow 100.5;200.5;300.5;world 1.1 events:reward conditions:correct_player_position Block: block \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player must break or place the specified amount of blocks. The first argument is a Block Selector . Next is amount. It can be more than 0 for placing and less than 0 for destroying. You can also use the notify keyword to display messages to the player each time he updates amount of blocks, optionally with the notification interval after colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of blocks already done, left is the amount of blocks still needed to complete the objective and total is the amount of blocks initially needed. Note that it follows the same rules as the amount argument, meaning that blocks to break are a negative number! Example block LOG -16 events:reward notify:5 Breed animals: breed \ud83d\udd17 This objective is completed by breeding animals of specified type. The first argument is the animal type and the second argument is the amount (positive integer). You can add the notify argument to display a message with the remaining amount each time the animal is bred, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. While you can specify any entity, the objective will be completable only for breedable ones. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of animals already breed, left is the amount of animals still needed to breed and total is the amount of animals initially required. Example breed cow 10 notify:2 events:reward Put items in a chest: chestput \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to put specified items in a specified chest. First argument is a location of the chest, second argument is a list of items (from items.yml file), separated with a comma. You can also add amount of items after a colon. The items will be removed upon completing the objective unless you add items-stay optional argument. Example chestput 100;200;300;world emerald:5,sword events:tag,message Eat/drink: consume \ud83d\udd17 This objective is completed by eating specified food or drinking specified potion. The only required argument is the ID of an item from items.yml . Example consume tawny_owl events:faster_endurance_regen Crafting: craft \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player must craft specified item. First argument is ID of the item, as in items.yml . Next is amount (integer). You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of items already crafted, left is the amount of items still needed to craft and total is the amount of items initially required. Example craft saddle 5 events:reward Enchant item: enchant \ud83d\udd17 This objectie is completed when the player enchants specified item with specified enchantment. The first argument is an item name, as defined it items.yml . Second one is the enchantment and a level, separated with a colon. If you need to check for multiple enchantments you can add a list of them, separated by colons. Example enchant sword damage_all:1,knockback:1 events:reward Experience: experience \ud83d\udd17 This objective can by completed by reaching specified amount of experience points. You can check for whole levels by adding the level argument. The conditions are checked when the player levels up, so if they are not met the first time, the player will have to meet them and levelup again. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the current amount of experience, left is the amount of experience still needed and total is the amount of experience required. Example experience 25 level events:reward Delay: delay \ud83d\udd17 This objective is just a long, persistent delay for firing events. It will run only after certain amount of time (measured in minutes) and only when player is online and meets all conditions. If a player is offline at that time it will just wait for them to log in. You should use it for example to delete tags so the player can complete quests multiple times. First argument is time, by default in minutes. You can also use ticks or seconds argument to use different units, but keep in mind that it's not very precise - it will complete roughly after the time ends. To control that precision you can specify an optional interval: argument, which specifies how many ticks should pass between checks. One second is 20 ticks. Less makes the objective more precise, at the expense of performance. The rest is just like in other objectives. Delay has two properties, left and date . The first one will show how much time needs to pass before the delay is completed (i.e. 23 days, 5 hours and 45 minutes ), the second one will show a date of completing the objective formatted using date_format setting in config.yml (it will look like the one above every journal entry). Example delay 1000 ticks interval:5 events:event1,event2 Death: die \ud83d\udd17 Death objective completes when the player dies meeting all conditions. You can optionally cancel death with cancel argument. It will heal player and optionally teleport him to respawn location. There can be two arguments: cancel , which is optional, and respawn: , which is also optional and only used if there is the cancel argument set. You can add them right after type of objective. Example die cancel respawn:100;200;300;world;90;0 events:teleport Fishing: fish \ud83d\udd17 Requires the player to catch something with the fishing rod. It doesn't have to be a fish, it can also be a treasure or junk. The first argument is a Block Selector of the item to catch. Second argument must be the amount of fish to catch. You can also add the notify argument if you want to display progress, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. The fish objective has three properties: left is the amount of fish still left to be caught, amount is the amount of already caught fish and total is the initially required amount of fish needed to be caught. Example fish SALMON 5 notify events:tag_fish_caught Interact with entity: interact \ud83d\udd17 The player must click on an entity to complete this objective. The first argument is the type of a click. Available values are right , left and any . Second required argument is the mob type . Next is an amount of mobs required to click on. These must be unique, so the player can't simply click twenty times on the same zombie to complete it. There is also an optional name: parameter which specifies what custom name the entity must have (you need to write _ instead of the space character). To check for the real name (e.g. if you renamed players to include their rank) you can also use realname: instead. Add marked: if the clicked entity needs to be marked by the spawn event (see its description for marking explanation). You can also add notify argument to make the objective notify players whenever they click a correct entity, optionally with the notification interval after colon and cancel if the click shouldn't do what it usually does (i.e. left click won't hurt the entity). This can be limited with an optional loc and range attribute to limit within a range of a location. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of entities already interacted with, left is the amount of entities still needed to be interacted with and total is the amount of entities initially required. Example interact right creeper 1 marked:sick condition:syringeInHand cancel Kill player: kill \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player needs to kill another player. The first argument is amount of players to kill. You can also specify additional arguments: name: followed by the name will only accept killing players with this name, required: followed by a list of conditions separated with commas will only accept killing players meeting these conditions and notify will display notifications when a player is killed, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. The kill objective has three properties: left is the amount of players still left to kill, amount is the amount of already killed players and total is the initially required amount to kill. Example kill 5 required:team_B Location: location \ud83d\udd17 This objective completes when player moves in specified range of specified location and meets all conditions. The first argument after objective's name must be location, the second - radius around the location. It can be a variable. Location objective contains one property, location . It's a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . Example location 100;200;300;world 5 condition:test1,!test2 events:test1,test2 Login: login \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player simply needs to login to the server. If you use global this objective will be also completed directly when the player joins the first time. If you use persistent it will be permanent. Don't forget that if you use global and persistent you can still remove the objective explicitly. Example login events:welcome_message Logout: logout \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player simply needs to leave the server. Keep in mind that running a folder event here will make it run in \"persistent\" mode, since the player is offline on the next tick. Example logout events:delete_objective Password: password \ud83d\udd17 This objective requires the player to write a certain password in chat. All attempts of a player will be hidden from public chat. The password consists of a prefix followed by the actual secret word: Solution: The Cake is a lie! ^prefix ^secret word(s) The objective's instruction string is defined as follows: The first argument is the password, use underscore characters ( _ ) instead of spaces. The password is a regular expression . They are a little complicated but worth the effort if you want more control over what exactly matches. Websites like regex101.com help with that complexity though. The offical documentation for regular expressions in Java might also help you. If you don't want to get into them just write down the password but keep in mind that the players answer needs to be an exact match! The prefix can be changed: The default (when no prefix is set) is the translated prefix from the messages.yml config in the user's language. Note that every custom prefix is suffixed with :\u2800 , so prefix:Library_password will require the user to enter Library password: myfancypassword . To disable the prefix use an empty prefix: declaration, e.g. password myfancypassword prefix: events:success . Be aware of these side effects that come with disabling the prefix: Nothing will be hidden on failure, so tries will be visible in chat and commands will get executed! If a command was used to enter the password, the command will not be canceled on success and thus still be executed! This ensures that even if your password is quest you can still execute the /quest command. You can also add the ignoreCase argument if you want a password's capitalization to be ignored. This is especially important for regex matching. If you want to trigger one or more events when the player failed to guess the password you can use the argument fail with a list of events (comma separated). With disabled prefix every command or chat message will trigger these events! Example password beton ignoreCase prefix:secret fail:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:message,reward Pickup item: pickup \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective you need to pickup the specified amount of items. The first argument must be the internal name of an item defined in items.yml . This can also be a comma-separated list of multiple items. You can optionally add the amount: argument to specify how many of these items the player needs to pickup. This amount is a total amount though, it does not count per each individual item. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. You can also add the notify keyword to display how many items are left to pickup. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of items already picked up, left is the amount of items still needed to pick up and total is the amount of items initially required. Example pickup emerald amount:3 events:reward notify pickup emerald,diamond amount:6 events:reward notify Mob Kill: mobkill \ud83d\udd17 The player must kill specified amount of mobs You must specify mob type first and then amount. You can find possible mob types here: mob types . Additionally you can specify names for mobs with name:Uber_Zombie , so only killing properly named mobs counts. All _ are replaced with spaces, so in this example you would have to kill 5 zombies with \"Uber Zombie\" above their heads. You can also specify notify keyword to display messages to the player each time he kills a mob, optionally with the notification interval after colon. If you want to accept only mobs marked with spawn event, use marked: argument followed by the keyword used in that event. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of mob already killed, left is the amount of mobs still needed to kill and total is the amount of mobs initially required. Example mobkill ZOMBIE 5 name:Uber_Zombie conditions:night Potion brewing: brew \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player needs to brew specified amount of specified potions. The first argument is a potion ID from items.yml . Second argument is amount of potions. You can optionally add notify argument to make the objective display progress to players, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. Progress will be counted for the player who last added or changed an item before the brew process completed. Only newly created potions are counted. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of potions already brewed, left is the amount of potions still needed to brew and total is the amount of potions initially required. Example brew weird_concoction 4 event:add_tag Sheep shearing: shear \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player has to shear specified amount of sheep, optionally with specified color and/or name. The first, required argument is amount (integer). Optionally, you can add a name: argument to only count specific sheep. All underscores will be replaced by spaces - if you want to use underscores, put a \\ before them. You can also check for the sheep's color: using these color names . You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of sheep already sheared, left is the amount of sheep still needed to shear and total is the amount of sheep initially required. Example shear 1 name:Bob color:black shear 1 name:jeb\\_ \"shear 1 name:jeb\\\\_\" #Use two backslashes if quoted Smelting: smelt \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player must smelt a specified item. Note that you must define the output item, not the ingredient. The first argument is a Block Selector for the output item. The second is the amount (integer). You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of items already smelted, left is the amount of items still needed to smelt and total is the amount of items initially required. Example smelt IRON_INGOT 5 events:reward Step on pressure plate: step \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player has to step on a pressure plate at a given location. The type of plate does not matter. The first and only required argument is a location. If the pressure plate is not present at that location, the objective will not be completable and will log errors in the console. Step objective contains one property, location . It shows the exact location of the pressure plate in a string formatted like X: 100, Y: 200, Z:300 . Example step 100;200;300;world events:done Taming: tame \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective player must tame some amount of mobs. First argument is type, second is amount. The mob must be tameable for the objective to be valid, e.g. on 1.16.5: CAT , DONKEY , HORSE , LLAMA , PARROT or WOLF . You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of animals already tamed, left is the amount of animals still needed to tame and total is the amount of animals initially required. Example tame WOLF 2 events:wolfs_tamed Jump!: jump \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective player must jump. The only argument is amount. You can use the notify keyword to display a message each time the player advances the objective, optionally with the notification interval after a colon. This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the amount of jumps already done, left is the amount of jumps still needed and total is the amount of jumps initially required. Example jump 15 events:legExerciseDone Ride an entity: ride \ud83d\udd17 This objective can be completed by riding the specified entity . any is also a valid input and matches any entity. Example ride horse ride any Run a Command: command \ud83d\udd17 To complete this objective the player must execute a specified command. It can be both an existing or a new, custom command. The first argument is the command text. Use _ in place of spaces for the command. If you need an actual _ in your command, you must escape it using a backslash ( \\ , see example below). The command argument is case-sensitive and also supports using placeholders. The second required argument is a list of events to execute when the objective is met. Example command /warp_%player%_farms events:event1,event2 command //replace_oak\\_wood events:event1,event2 With this configuration, the command objective requires the player to execute /warp MyName farms to be completed. The command objective matches from the start of the command that was executed, therefore if the player executed /warp MyName farms other arguments it would still be completed. Optional arguments: ignoreCase : If provided, instructs the objective to ignore case for the command to match. exact : If provided, requires an exact command match, not just the command start. cancel : If provided, the objective will cancel the execution of the command on a match. This needs to be enabled to suppress the Unknown Command message when using custom commands. failEvents : If provided, specifies a list of events to execute if a non-matching command is run and conditions are met. Complex command /warp_%player%_farms ignoreCase exact cancel failEvents:failEvent1,failEvent2 events:event1,event2 Warning Sometimes you want to use actual underscores in your command. These will however be replaced with spaces by default. You can \"escape\" them using backslashes: One backslash ( \\ ) is required when using no quoting at all ( ... ) or single quotes ( '...' ). Two backslashes are required ( \\\\ ) when using double quotes ( \"...\" ). Examples: eventName: command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua_affinity eventName:command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua \\ _affinity eventName: ' command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua_affinity ' eventName: ' command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua \\ _affinity ' eventName: \" command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua_affinity \" eventName: \" command /enchant_@s_minecraft:aqua \\\\ _affinity \" Variable: variable \ud83d\udd17 This objective is different. You cannot complete it, it will also ignore defined events and conditions. You can start it and that's it. While this objective is active though, everything the player types in chat (and matches special pattern) will become a variable. The pattern is key: value . So if you type that, it will create a variable called key , which will resolve to value string. These are not global variables, you can access them as objective properties. Let's say you defined this objective as var in your objectives.yml file. You can access the variable in any conversation, event or condition with %objective.var.key% - and in case of this example, it will resolve to value . The player can type something else, and the variable will change its value. Variables are per-player, so my key variable will be different from your key variable, depending on what we were typing in chat. You can have as much variables here as you want. To remove this objective use objective delete event - there is no other way. You can also use variable event to change variables stored in this objective. There is one optional argument, no-chat . If you use it, the objective won't be modified by what players type in chat.

This objective has three properties: amount , left and total . amount is the current amount of experience, left is the amount of experience still needed and total is the amount of experience required. Example experience 25 level events:reward","title":"Experience: experience"},{"location":"Documentation/Objectives-List/#delay-delay","text":"This objective is just a long, persistent delay for firing events. It will run only after certain amount of time (measured in minutes) and only when player is online and meets all conditions. If a player is offline at that time it will just wait for them to log in. You should use it for example to delete tags so the player can complete quests multiple times. First argument is time, by default in minutes. You can also use ticks or seconds argument to use different units, but keep in mind that it's not very precise - it will complete roughly after the time ends. To control that precision you can specify an optional interval: argument, which specifies how many ticks should pass between checks. One second is 20 ticks. Less makes the objective more precise, at the expense of performance. The rest is just like in other objectives. Delay has two properties, left and date . The first one will show how much time needs to pass before the delay is completed (i.e. 23 days, 5 hours and 45 minutes ), the second one will show a date of completing the objective formatted using date_format setting in config.yml (it will look like the one above every journal entry).

These must be unique, so the player can't simply click twenty times on the same zombie to complete it. There is also an optional name: parameter which specifies what custom name the entity must have (you need to write _ instead of the space character). To check for the real name (e.g. if you renamed players to include their rank) you can also use realname: instead. Add marked: if the clicked entity needs to be marked by the spawn event (see its description for marking explanation). You can also add notify argument to make the objective notify players whenever they click a correct entity, optionally with the notification interval after colon and cancel if the click shouldn't do what it usually does (i.e. left click won't hurt the entity). This can be limited with an optional loc and range attribute to limit within a range of a location.

All attempts of a player will be hidden from public chat. The password consists of a prefix followed by the actual secret word: Solution: The Cake is a lie! ^prefix ^secret word(s) The objective's instruction string is defined as follows: The first argument is the password, use underscore characters ( _ ) instead of spaces. The password is a regular expression . They are a little complicated but worth the effort if you want more control over what exactly matches. Websites like regex101.com help with that complexity though. The offical documentation for regular expressions in Java might also help you. If you don't want to get into them just write down the password but keep in mind that the players answer needs to be an exact match! The prefix can be changed: The default (when no prefix is set) is the translated prefix from the messages.yml config in the user's language. Note that every custom prefix is suffixed with :\u2800 , so prefix:Library_password will require the user to enter Library password: myfancypassword . To disable the prefix use an empty prefix: declaration, e.g. password myfancypassword prefix: events:success . Be aware of these side effects that come with disabling the prefix: Nothing will be hidden on failure, so tries will be visible in chat and commands will get executed! If a command was used to enter the password, the command will not be canceled on success and thus still be executed! This ensures that even if your password is quest you can still execute the /quest command. You can also add the ignoreCase argument if you want a password's capitalization to be ignored. This is especially important for regex matching. If you want to trigger one or more events when the player failed to guess the password you can use the argument fail with a list of events (comma separated). With disabled prefix every command or chat message will trigger these events!

Example variable","title":"Variable: variable"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/","text":"Reference \ud83d\udd17 This chapter describes all aspects of BetonQuest in one place. You should read it at least once to know what you're dealing with and where to search for information if you ever have any problems. Conditions, Events and Objectives \ud83d\udd17 Conditions, events and objectives are defined with an \"instruction string\". It's a piece of text, formatted in a specific way, containing the instruction for the condition/event/objective. Thanks to this string they know what should they do. To define the instruction string you will need a reference, few pages below. It describes how something behaves and how it should be created. All instruction strings are defined in appropriate files, for example all conditions are in conditions.yml config. The syntax used to define them looks like this: name: 'the instruction string containing the data' . Apostrophes are optional in most cases, you can find out when to use them by looking up \"YAML syntax\" in Google. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Conditions are the most versatile and useful tools in creating advanced quests. They allow you to control what options are available to player in conversations, how the NPC responds or if the objective will be completed. The reference of all possible conditions is down below. You can negate the condition (revert its output) by adding an exclamation mark ( ! ) at the beginning of it's name (in the place you use it, i.e. in conversations, not in the conditions.yml file). You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in conditions. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead. Events \ud83d\udd17 In certain moments you will want something to happen. Updating the journal, setting tags, giving rewards, all these are done using events. You define them just like conditions, by specifying a name and instruction string. You can find instruction strings to all events in the event reference. At the end of the instruction string you can add conditions: or condition: (with or without s at the end) attribute followed by a list of condition names separated by commas, like conditions:angry,!quest_started . This will make an event fire only when these conditions are met. You can use conversation variables instead of numeric arguments in events. If the variable fails to resolve (i.e. it will return an empty string) BetonQuest will use 0 instead. Objectives \ud83d\udd17 Objectives are the main things you will use when creating complex quests. You start them with a special event, objective . You define them in the objectives.yml file, just as you would conditions or events. At the end of the instruction string you can add conditions and events for the objective. Conditions will limit when the objective can be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location in quest for defending city gates), and events will fire when the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC). You define these like that: conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2 at the end of instruction string . Separate them by commas and never use spaces! You can also use singular forms of these arguments: condition: and event: . If you want to start an objective right after it was completed (for example die objective: when you die, teleport you to a special spawnpoint and start die objective again), you can add persistent argument at the end of an instruction string. It will prevent the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such objective you will need to use objective delete event. Objectives are loaded at start-up, but they do not consume resources without player actually having them active. This means that if you have 100 objectives defined, and 20 players doing one objective, 20 another players doing second objective, and the rest objectives are inactive (no one does them), then only 2 objectives will be consuming your server resources, not 100, not 40. Packages \ud83d\udd17 All the content you create is organized into packages. Each package must contain the main.yml file with package-specific settings. Additionally it can have conversations directory with conversation files, events.yml , conditions.yml , objectives.yml , items.yml and journal.yml . The default package is called simply \"default\". It is always present, and if you delete it, it will be regenerated with a sample quest. If you want, you can simply ignore the existence of packages and write all your quests in the default one. You will however come to a point, when your files contain hundreds of lines and it gets a little bit confusing. That's why it's better to split your quests into multiple packages, for example \"main\" for the quests in the main city, \"dungeon\" for some interesting dungeon story etc. Each package can be disabled/enabled in the main.yml file, by setting enabled to true or false . #Add this to the package main.yml enabled : true It would be limiting if you couldn't interact between packages. That's why you can always access stuff from other packages by prefixing its name with package name. If you're writing a conversation in package village and you want to fire an event reward from package beton , you simply name the event as beton.reward . The plugin will search for reward in beton package instead of the one in which the conversation is defined. All events, conditions, objectives, items and conversations behave this way. Note that you can't cross-reference journal entries! Packages can be nested together in folders. A folder can either contain packages or be a package, never both. The name of such nested package is prefixed by names of all folders, separated with a dash. This directory tree ( main.yml represents a package): BetonQuest/ \u251c\u2500default/ \u2514\u2500quests/ \u251c\u2500village1/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500quest1/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500main.yml \u2502 \u2514\u2500quest2/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500main.yml \u2514\u2500village2/ \u2514\u2500quest1/ \u2514\u2500main.yml contains these packages: default quests-village1-quest1 quests-village1-quest2 quests-village2-quest1 Relative paths \ud83d\udd17 You don't have to always specify a full package name. In the example above, if you wanted to reference package quests-village1-quest2 from quests-village1-quest1 , you could write it as _-quest2 - this means \"from the current package ( quest1 ) go up one time and find there package quest2 \". Name _ has special meaning here. Analogously, if you wanted to reference quests-village2-quest1 from that package, you would use _-_-village2-quest1 . Using _ twice will get you to quests package, and from there you're going into village2 and then quest1 . Relative paths can be useful if you want to move your packages between directories. Instead of rewriting every package name to match current directory tree, you can use relative paths and it will just work. It can also be useful if you want to create a downloadable quest package which can be placed anywhere and not just on the root directory ( BetonQuest/ ) or when working with BetonQuest-Editor + BetonQuestUploader combo - quest writers don't have to prefix every package call with their name (this feature will work soon, needs an update in the editor). Unified location formating \ud83d\udd17 Whenever you want to define some location in your events, conditions, objectives or any other things, you will define it with this specific format. The location can consist of 2 things: base and vector. Only the base is always required. The base is a core location. Currently there are two types: absolute coordinates and variables. Absolute coordinates are defined like 100;200;300;world , where 100 is X coordinate, 200 is Y, 300 is Z and world is the name of the world. These can have decimal values. If you want you can also add two more numbers at the end, yaw and pitch (these are controlling the rotation, for example in teleportation event, both are needed if you decide to add them; example: 0.5;64;0.5;world;90;-270 ). To use a variable as the location's base it must resolve to a valid absolute coordinates. An example of such variable is %location% , which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though: you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from folder event after their player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the player! The vector is a modification of the location. It will be useful if you use global variables instead of base (described in the next subsection) or the base itself is variable, like player . Vectors look like ->(10;2.5;-13) and are added to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as 100;200;300;world_nether->(10;2.5;-13) will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 on world_nether world. Global variables \ud83d\udd17 You can insert a global variable in any instruction string. It looks like this: $beton$ (and this one would be called \"beton\"). When the plugin loads that instruction string it will replace those variables with values assigned to them in main.yml file before the instruction string is parsed. This is useful for example when installing a package containing a WorldEdit schematic of the quest building. Instead of going through the whole code to set those locations, names or texts you will only have to specify a few variables (that is, of course, if the author of the package used those variables properly in his code). Note that these variables are something entirely different than conversation variables. Global ones use $ characters and conversation ones use % characters. The former is resolved before the instruction string is parsed while the latter is resolved when the quests are running, usually on a per-player basis. variables : village_location : 100;200;300;world village_name : Concrete Canceling quests \ud83d\udd17 If you want to let your players cancel their quest there is a function for that. In main.yml file there is cancel branch. You can specify there quests, which can be canceled, as well as actions that need to be done to actually cancel them. You can find an example in the default package. The arguments you can specify are: name - this will be the name displayed to the player. All _ characters will be converted to spaces. If you want to include other languages you can add here additional options ( en for English etc.) conditions - this is a list of conditions separated by commas. The player needs to meet all those conditions to be able to cancel this quest. Place there the ones which detect that the player has started the quest, but he has not finished it yet. objectives - list of all objectives used in this quest. They will be canceled without firing their events. tags - this is a list of tags that will be deleted. Place here all tags that you use during the quest. points - list of all categories that will be entirely deleted. journal - these journal entries will be deleted when canceling the quest. events - if you want to do something else when canceling the quest (like punishing the player), list the events here. loc - this is a location to which the player will be teleported when canceling the quest (defined as in teleport event); To cancel the quest you need to open your backpack and select a \"cancel\" button (by default a bone, can be changes by naming an item \"cancel_button\" inside default package). There will be a list of quests which can be canceled. Just select the one that interests you and it will be canceled. Global objectives \ud83d\udd17 If you want a objective to be active for every player right after joining you can create a global objective. This is done by adding global argument to the instruction of the objective. When you then reload BetonQuest it is started for all online players and also will be started for every player who joins. To prevent the objective from being started every time a player joins a tag is set for the player whenever the objective is started and as long as the player has the tag the objective wont be started again if the player joins. These tags follow syntax <package>.global-<id> , where <id> is the objectives id and <package> the package where the objective is located. Possible use cases would be a quest which starts if a player reaches a specific location or breaks a specific block. Example: start_quest_mine : 'location 100;200;300;world 5 events:start_quest_mine_folder global' Static events \ud83d\udd17 Static events are events that will fire at the specified time of the day. It is possible to address multiple events with a , separated list. They are not tied to a specific player, so not all event types can be used as static. (Which player should receive a tag or objective? From which one should the items be taken?) Also, static events cannot have conditions defined ( event-conditions: argument), as the plugin cannot check any condition without the player. Events, that can be used as static are flagged with static keyword in this documentation. You can define your static events in main.yml file under static section, as such: static : '09:00' : beton '23:59' : lightning_strike '11:23' : some_command,command_announcement The hour must be in '' to avoid problems, it needs leading zero if less than 10. beton , lightnint_strike etc. are IDs of events. Journal \ud83d\udd17 The journal is a book in which all your adventures are described. You can obtain it by typing /j command or /b and selecting it from backpack. You cannot put it into any chests, item frames and so on. If you ever feel the need to get rid of your journal, just drop it - it will return to your backpack. The journal is updated with the journal event, and the text inside is defined in journal.yml config file. If you update these texts and reload the plugin, all players' journals will reflect changes. Colors in the journal can be altered in config.yml. The entries can use color codes, but the color will be lost between pages. The journal by default appears in the last slot of the hotbar. If you want to change that use default_journal_slot option in config.yml , experiment with different settings until you're ok with it. If you want to translate the entry do the same thing as with conversation option - go to new line, add language ID and the journal text for every language you want to include. You can control behavior of the journal in config.yml file, in journal section. chars_per_page specifies how many characters will be placed on a single page. If you set it too high, the text will overflow outside of the page, too low, there will be too much pages. one_entry_per_page allows you to place every entry on a single page. The chars_per_page setting is in this case ignored, BetonQuest will put entire entry on that page. reversed_order allows you to reverse order of entries and hide_date lets you remove the date from journal entries. You can control colors in the journal in journal_colors section in config.yml : date is a color of date of every entry, line is a color of lines separating entries and text is just a color of a text. You need to use standard color codes without & (eg. '4' for dark red). You can also add a main page to the journal. It's a list of texts, which will show only if specified conditions are met. You can define them in the main.yml file, in the journal_main_page section: journal_main_page : title : priority : 1 text : en : '&eThe Journal' pl : '&eDziennik' conditions : 'quest_started,!quest_completed' Each string can have text in different languages, list of conditions separated by commas (these must be met for the text to show in the journal) and priority , which controls the order of texts. You can use conversation variables in the texts, but they will only be updated when the player gets his journal with the /journal command. Color codes are supported. If you want your main page take a separate page (so entries will be displayed on next free page), set full_main_page in config.yml to \"true\". If you want to manually wrap the page, use the pipe | character. Use \\n to go to a new line. Tags \ud83d\udd17 Tags are little pieces of text you can assign to player and then check if he has them. They are particularly useful to determine if player has started or completed quest. They are given with tag event and checked with tag condition. All tags are bound to a package, so if you add beton tag from within the default package, the tag will look like default.beton . If you're checking for beton tag from within default package, you're actually checking for default.beton . If you want to check a tag from another package, then you just need to prefix it's name with that package, for example quest.beton . Points \ud83d\udd17 Points are like tags, but with amount. You can earn them for doing quest, talking with NPC\u2019s, basically for everything you want. You can also take the points away, even to negative numbers. Points can be divided to categories, so the ones from beton category won\u2019t mix with points from quests group. Of course then you can check if player has (or doesn\u2019t have) certain amount and do something based on this condition. They can be used as counter for specific number of quest done, as a reputation system in villages and even NPC\u2019s attitude to player. NPCs \ud83d\udd17 Conversations can be assigned to NPCs created with Citizens. You do it in the main.yml file inside a package, in npcs section: npcs : '0' : innkeeper '4' : woodcutter The first string is the ID of the NPC ( don't try to put Citizens NPC's name here, it must be the ID ), second one is the corresponding conversation file name ( without .yml at the end ). To acquire the NPCs ID select the NPC and type /npc or /npc id . You can assign the same conversation to multiple NPCs. Note The Citizens ID must be enclosed in quotes. Items \ud83d\udd17 Items in BetonQuest are defined in items.yml file. Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc. Basic syntax is very simple: item : BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments... BLOCK_SELECTOR is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be name (for every item type) and text (only in books). Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than x . You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items. These are arguments that can be applied to every item: name - the display name of the item. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use none keyword. lore - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. To make a new line use ; character. If you require the item not to have lore at all, use none keyword. By default lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items which contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add lore-containing argument to the instruction string. enchants - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons: name level (a positive number) For example damage_all:3 is Sharpness III . You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas. You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using none keyword. You can also add + / - character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark. By default all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add enchants-containing argument to the instruction string. Each specified enchantment will be required on the item by default unless you prefix its name with none- , for example none-knockback means that the item must not have any knockback enchantment. Do not use none- prefix unless you're using enchants-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and will break the check! unbreakable - this makes the item unbreakable. You can specify it either as unbreakable or unbreakable:true to require an item to be unbreakable. If you want to check if the item is breakable, use unbreakable:false . custom-model-data - set the custom model data of the item. You have to specify the data value: custom-model-data:3 . To check that an item does not have custom model data set no-custom-model-data . Examples : name:&4Sword_made_of_Holy_Concrete name:none lore:&cOnly_this_sword_can_kill_the_Lord_Ruler lore:&2Quest_Item lore-containing lore:none enchants:damage_all:3+,none-knockback enchants:power:? enchants-containing enchants:none unbreakable unbreakable:false These are the arguments that can be applied only to specific item types: Books \ud83d\udd17 This applies to a written book and a book and quill. title - the title of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any title, use none keyword. author - the author of a book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces, you cannot use color codes here. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any author, use none keyword. text - the text of the book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. The text will wrap to the next page if amount of characters exceeds journal.chars_per_page setting in config.yml . If you want to manually wrap the page, use | character. To go to new line use \\n . Keep in mind that you can't use any spaces here, you must only use underscores ( _ ). This needs to be a single argument, even if it's really long. If you don't want the book to have any text, use none keyword instead. Examples : title:Malleus_Maleficarum author:&eGallus_Anonymus text:Lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet,\\nconsectetur_adipiscing_elit.|Pellentesque_ligula_urna(...) Potions \ud83d\udd17 This applies to potions, splash potions and lingering potions. type - type of a potion. Here's the list of possible types. Do not mistake this for a custom effect, this argument corresponds to the default vanilla potion types. extended - extended property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding redstone). It can be specified as extended or extended:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT extended, use extended:false . upgraded - upgraded property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding glowstone). It can be specified as upgraded or upgraded:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT upgraded, use upgraded:false . effects - a list of custom effects. These are independent of the potion type. The effects must be separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things, separated by colons: type (this is different stuff that the link above!) power duration (in seconds) An example would be WITHER:2:30 , which is a wither effect of level 2 for 30 seconds. If you want to target only potions without custom effects, use none keyword. You can target potions with level and time greater/less (and equal) than specified with + / - character after the number. If you don't care about the level/time, you can replace them with question mark. By default all specified effects are required. If you want to check if the potion contains these effects among others, add effects-containing argument to the instruction string. Now if you want to make sure the potion doesn't contain a specific effect, prefix the effect name with none- . Don't use that prefix unless you're also using effects-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and it will break the check. Examples : type:instant_heal extended upgraded:false effects:poison:1+:?,slow:?:45- effects:none-weakness,invisibility:?:? effects-containing Heads \ud83d\udd17 This applies to human heads. owner - this is the name of the head owner. It will not use color codes nor replace underscores with spaces. If you want to check for heads without any owner, use none keyword. Examples : owner:Co0sh owner:none Leather armor \ud83d\udd17 This applies to all parts of leather armor. color - this is the color of the armor piece. It can be either one of these values , a hexadecimal RGB value prefixed with # character or its decimal representation without the prefix. You can also check if the armor piece doesn't have any color with none keyword. Examples : color:light_blue color:#ff00ff color:none Fireworks \ud83d\udd17 This applies to fireworks. firework - this is a list of effects of the firework rocket. They are separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things separated by colons: effect type a list of main colors (refer to leather armor colors above for syntax) separated by semicolons a list of fade colors true / false keyword for trail effect true / false keyword for flicker. Note the separation characters, this is important: commas separate effects, colons separate effect properties, semicolons separate colors. If you want to target fireworks without any effects, use none keyword. If you want to target any effect type, use question mark instead of the effect name. If you don't want the effect to have any main/fade colors, use none keyword in the place of colors. If you don't care about main/fade colors, use question marks in that place. If you don't care about trail/flicker effect, use question marks instead of true / false keyword. By default the check will require all specified effects to be present on the firework. You can check if the firework contains specified effects among others by adding firework-containing argument to the instruction string. To match the item which must not have an effect, prefix the effect name with none- keyword. Don't use that prefix unless you're also using firework-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and will break the check. power - flight duration of the firework, in levels. You can use + / - character to target greater/less (and equal) levels. Examples : firework:ball:red;white:green;blue:true:true,ball_large:green;yellow:pink;black:false:false firework:burst:?:none:?:? firework-containing firework:none-creeper firework-containing firework:none power:3 power:2+ Firework charges \ud83d\udd17 This applies to firework charges. firework - this is almost the same as fireworks. You can only specify a single effect and the power argument has no effects. Backpack \ud83d\udd17 Sometimes you'll want some items to be persistent over death. The quest could be broken if the player loses them. Such an item wouldn't be dropped (on death), instead it would be placed in the player's backpack. You can add a specific line to an item's lore to make it persistent. It's &2Quest_Item ( _ is a space in an item's definition) if your default language is english. The translation of the line can be found in messages.yml if a different default language is configured. It's also possible to change the translation. Note that this must be an entirely new line in the lore! Example : important_sword : \"DIAMOND_SWORD name:Sword_for_destroying__The_Concrete lore:Made_of_pure_Mithril;&2Quest_Item\" To open your backpack just type /j command. The inventory window will open, displaying your stored items. The first slot is always the journal, and if you get it, the slot will stay empty. You can transfer quest items back and forth between inventories by clicking on them. Left click will transfer just one item, right click will try to transfer all items. Normal items cannot be stored into the backpack, so it's not an infinite inventory. If you will ever have more than one page of quest items, the buttons will appear. You can customize those buttons by creating previous_button and next_button items in items.yml file. Their name will be overwritten with the one defined in messages.yml . Quest items cannot be dropped in any way other than using them. This way you can create a quest for eating cookies by giving the player a stack of cookies flagged as quest items and not continuing until there are no more cookies in his inventory/backpack. The player cannot drop the cookies, so he must eat every one of them to complete the quest. Don't worry if the item-dropping filter isn't working for your items when you're in creative mode - it's not a bug. It's a feature. Creative-mode players should be able to easily put quest items in containers like TreasureChests. Party \ud83d\udd17 Parties are very simple. So simple, that they are hard to understand if you already know some other party system. Basically, they don't even have to be created before using them. Parties are defined directly in conditions/events ( party event, party conditions, check them out in the reference lists below). In such instruction strings the first argument is a number - range. It defines the radius where the party members will be looked for. Second is a list of conditions. Only the players that meet those conditions will be considered as members of the party. It's most intuitive for players, as they don't have to do anything to be in a party - no commands, no GUIs, just starting the same quest or having the same item - you choose what and when makes the party. To understand better how it works I will show you an example of party event. Let's say that every player has an objective of pressing a button. When one of them presses it, this event is fired: party_reward : party 50 quest_started cancel_button,teleport_to_dungeon Now, it means that all players that: are in radius of 50 blocks around the player who pressed the button AND meet quest_started condition will receive cancel_button and teleport_to_dungeon events. The first one will cancel the quest for pressing the button for the others (it's no longer needed), the second one will teleport them somewhere. Now, imagine there is a player on the other side of the world who also meets quest_started condition - he won't be teleported into the dungeon, because he was not with the other players (not in 50 blocks range). Now, there were a bunch of other players running around the button, but they didn't meet the quest_started condition. They also won't be teleported (they didn't start this quest). Block Selectors \ud83d\udd17 When specifying a way of matching a block, a block selector is used. Format \ud83d\udd17 The format of a block selector is: namespace:material[state=value,...] Where: namespace - (optional) The material namespace. If left out then it will be assumed to be 'minecraft'. Can be a regex . material - The material the block is made of. All materials can be found in Spigots Javadocs . It can be a regex . If the regex ends with square brackets you have to add another pair of empty square brackets even if you don't want to use the state argument ( [regex][] ). Instead of using a regex to match multiple materials you can also define a tag . Every tag matches a special group of blocks or items that can be grouped together logically. They can be used using this format :blocks:flowers or minecraft:blocks:flowers . Be aware that a tag always starts with either : or a namespace. state - (optional) The block states can be provided in a comma separated key=value list surrounded by square brackets. You can look up states in the Minecraft wiki . Any states left out will be ignored when matching. Values can be a regex . Examples: minecraft:stone - Matches all blocks of type STONE redstone_wire - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE redstone_wire[power=5] - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have a power of 5 redstone_wire[power=5,facing=1] - Matches all blocks of type REDSTONE_WIRE and which have both a power of 5 and are facing 1 .*_LOG - Matches all LOGS .* - Matches everything .*[waterlogged=true] - Matches all waterlogged blocks minecraft:blocks:flowers - Matches all flowers :blocks:crops[age=0] - Matches all crops with an age of 0 meaning, not grown / just planted Setting behaviour \ud83d\udd17 A block selector with a regex or tag as it's material name results in a random block out of all blocks that match that regex or tag. You cannot use a regex in block states when the block selector is used for placing blocks. Matching behaviour \ud83d\udd17 The block state will ignore all additional block states on the block it's compared with by default. Example: fence[facing=north] matches fence[facing=north] and fence[facing=north,waterlogged=true] You can add an exactMatch argument if you only want to match blocks that exactly match the block state. A regex is allowed in any block state value when the block selector is used to match blocks. Hiding Player's \ud83d\udd17 Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos. You can also hide players for specific players in the custom.yml . If the source_player meets the conditions every player that meets the target_player conditions is completely hidden for him. This is really helpful if you want a lonely place on your server, or your quests break when multiple players can see or affect each other. You can configure the interval which checks the conditions in the config.yml . Special behaviour: A player that meets the source_player conditions can't be pushed anymore by other players. By leaving the e.g. source_player argument empty it will match all players. player_hider : example_hider : #All players in a special region cannot see any other players in that region. source_player : in_StoryRegion target_player : in_StoryRegion another_hider : #No one can see any players inside a secret room. #The source_player argument is left out to match all players. target_player : in_secretRoom empty_hider : #in_Lobby is a world condition. Therefore, the lobby world appears empty for everyone that is in it. source_player : in_Lobby #The target_player argument is left out to match all players.","title":"\ud83d\udcda \u200a\u200aReference"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#reference","text":"This chapter describes all aspects of BetonQuest in one place.

All instruction strings are defined in appropriate files, for example all conditions are in conditions.yml config.

Conditions will limit when the objective can be completed (e.g. killing zombies only at given location in quest for defending city gates), and events will fire when the objective is completed (e.g. giving a reward, or setting a tag which will enable collecting a reward from an NPC). You define these like that: conditions:con1,con2 events:event1,event2 at the end of instruction string . Separate them by commas and never use spaces! You can also use singular forms of these arguments: condition: and event: . If you want to start an objective right after it was completed (for example die objective: when you die, teleport you to a special spawnpoint and start die objective again), you can add persistent argument at the end of an instruction string. It will prevent the objective from being completed, although it will run all its events. To cancel such objective you will need to use objective delete event. Objectives are loaded at start-up, but they do not consume resources without player actually having them active. This means that if you have 100 objectives defined, and 20 players doing one objective, 20 another players doing second objective, and the rest objectives are inactive (no one does them), then only 2 objectives will be consuming your server resources, not 100, not 40.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#packages","text":"All the content you create is organized into packages. Each package must contain the main.yml file with package-specific settings. Additionally it can have conversations directory with conversation files, events.yml , conditions.yml , objectives.yml , items.yml and journal.yml . The default package is called simply \"default\". It is always present, and if you delete it, it will be regenerated with a sample quest. If you want, you can simply ignore the existence of packages and write all your quests in the default one. You will however come to a point, when your files contain hundreds of lines and it gets a little bit confusing. That's why it's better to split your quests into multiple packages, for example \"main\" for the quests in the main city, \"dungeon\" for some interesting dungeon story etc. Each package can be disabled/enabled in the main.yml file, by setting enabled to true or false . #Add this to the package main.yml enabled : true It would be limiting if you couldn't interact between packages. That's why you can always access stuff from other packages by prefixing its name with package name. If you're writing a conversation in package village and you want to fire an event reward from package beton , you simply name the event as beton.reward . The plugin will search for reward in beton package instead of the one in which the conversation is defined. All events, conditions, objectives, items and conversations behave this way. Note that you can't cross-reference journal entries! Packages can be nested together in folders. A folder can either contain packages or be a package, never both.

Using _ twice will get you to quests package, and from there you're going into village2 and then quest1 . Relative paths can be useful if you want to move your packages between directories. Instead of rewriting every package name to match current directory tree, you can use relative paths and it will just work. It can also be useful if you want to create a downloadable quest package which can be placed anywhere and not just on the root directory ( BetonQuest/ ) or when working with BetonQuest-Editor + BetonQuestUploader combo - quest writers don't have to prefix every package call with their name (this feature will work soon, needs an update in the editor).","title":"Relative paths"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#unified-location-formating","text":"Whenever you want to define some location in your events, conditions, objectives or any other things, you will define it with this specific format. The location can consist of 2 things: base and vector. Only the base is always required. The base is a core location. Currently there are two types: absolute coordinates and variables. Absolute coordinates are defined like 100;200;300;world , where 100 is X coordinate, 200 is Y, 300 is Z and world is the name of the world. These can have decimal values. If you want you can also add two more numbers at the end, yaw and pitch (these are controlling the rotation, for example in teleportation event, both are needed if you decide to add them; example: 0.5;64;0.5;world;90;-270 ). To use a variable as the location's base it must resolve to a valid absolute coordinates. An example of such variable is %location% , which shows player's exact location. Simply place it instead of coordinates. There is one rule though: you can't use variable base types in events running without players (for example static events or the ones run from folder event after their player left the server). BetonQuest won't be able to resolve the location variable without the player! The vector is a modification of the location. It will be useful if you use global variables instead of base (described in the next subsection) or the base itself is variable, like player . Vectors look like ->(10;2.5;-13) and are added to the end of the base. This will modify the location, X by 10, Y by 2.5 and Z by -13. For example, location written as 100;200;300;world_nether->(10;2.5;-13) will generate a location with X=110, Y=202.5 and Z=287 on world_nether world.","title":"Unified location formating"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#global-variables","text":"You can insert a global variable in any instruction string.

This is useful for example when installing a package containing a WorldEdit schematic of the quest building. Instead of going through the whole code to set those locations, names or texts you will only have to specify a few variables (that is, of course, if the author of the package used those variables properly in his code).

You can obtain it by typing /j command or /b and selecting it from backpack. You cannot put it into any chests, item frames and so on. If you ever feel the need to get rid of your journal, just drop it - it will return to your backpack. The journal is updated with the journal event, and the text inside is defined in journal.yml config file. If you update these texts and reload the plugin, all players' journals will reflect changes. Colors in the journal can be altered in config.yml. The entries can use color codes, but the color will be lost between pages. The journal by default appears in the last slot of the hotbar. If you want to change that use default_journal_slot option in config.yml , experiment with different settings until you're ok with it. If you want to translate the entry do the same thing as with conversation option - go to new line, add language ID and the journal text for every language you want to include. You can control behavior of the journal in config.yml file, in journal section. chars_per_page specifies how many characters will be placed on a single page. If you set it too high, the text will overflow outside of the page, too low, there will be too much pages. one_entry_per_page allows you to place every entry on a single page. The chars_per_page setting is in this case ignored, BetonQuest will put entire entry on that page. reversed_order allows you to reverse order of entries and hide_date lets you remove the date from journal entries. You can control colors in the journal in journal_colors section in config.yml : date is a color of date of every entry, line is a color of lines separating entries and text is just a color of a text. You need to use standard color codes without & (eg. '4' for dark red). You can also add a main page to the journal. It's a list of texts, which will show only if specified conditions are met. You can define them in the main.yml file, in the journal_main_page section: journal_main_page : title : priority : 1 text : en : '&eThe Journal' pl : '&eDziennik' conditions : 'quest_started,!quest_completed' Each string can have text in different languages, list of conditions separated by commas (these must be met for the text to show in the journal) and priority , which controls the order of texts. You can use conversation variables in the texts, but they will only be updated when the player gets his journal with the /journal command. Color codes are supported. If you want your main page take a separate page (so entries will be displayed on next free page), set full_main_page in config.yml to \"true\". If you want to manually wrap the page, use the pipe | character. Use \\n to go to a new line.","title":"Journal"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#tags","text":"Tags are little pieces of text you can assign to player and then check if he has them. They are particularly useful to determine if player has started or completed quest. They are given with tag event and checked with tag condition. All tags are bound to a package, so if you add beton tag from within the default package, the tag will look like default.beton . If you're checking for beton tag from within default package, you're actually checking for default.beton .

Of course then you can check if player has (or doesn\u2019t have) certain amount and do something based on this condition.

To acquire the NPCs ID select the NPC and type /npc or /npc id . You can assign the same conversation to multiple NPCs. Note The Citizens ID must be enclosed in quotes.","title":"NPCs"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#items","text":"Items in BetonQuest are defined in items.yml file. Each item has an instruction string, similarly to events, conditions etc. Basic syntax is very simple: item : BLOCK_SELECTOR other arguments... BLOCK_SELECTOR is a type of the item. It doesn't have to be all in uppercase. Other arguments specify data like name of the item, lore, enchantments or potion effects. There are two categories of these arguments: the ones you can apply to every item and type specific arguments. Examples would be name (for every item type) and text (only in books). Every argument is used in two ways: when creating an item and when checking if some existing item matches the instruction. The first case is pretty straightforward - BetonQuest takes all data you specified and creates an item, simple as that. Second case is more complicated. You can require some property of the item to exist, other not to exist, or skip this property check altogether. You can also accept an item only if some value (like enchantment level) is greater/less than x . You can use wildcards in the BLOCK_SELECTOR to match multiple types of items. These are arguments that can be applied to every item: name - the display name of the item. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. If you want to specifically say that the item must not have any name, use none keyword. lore - text under the item's name. Default styling of lore is purple and italic. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. To make a new line use ; character. If you require the item not to have lore at all, use none keyword. By default lore will match only if all lines are exactly the same. If you want to accept all items which contain specified lines (and/or more lines), add lore-containing argument to the instruction string. enchants - a list of enchantments and their levels. Each enchantment consists of these things, separated by colons: name level (a positive number) For example damage_all:3 is Sharpness III . You can specify additional enchantments by separating them with commas. You can require the item not to have any enchantments by using none keyword. You can also add + / - character to the enchantment level to make the check require levels greater/less (and equal) than specified. If you don't care about the level, replace the number with a question mark. By default all specified enchantments are required. If you want to check if the item contains a matching enchantment (and/or more enchants), add enchants-containing argument to the instruction string. Each specified enchantment will be required on the item by default unless you prefix its name with none- , for example none-knockback means that the item must not have any knockback enchantment. Do not use none- prefix unless you're using enchants-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and will break the check! unbreakable - this makes the item unbreakable. You can specify it either as unbreakable or unbreakable:true to require an item to be unbreakable. If you want to check if the item is breakable, use unbreakable:false . custom-model-data - set the custom model data of the item. You have to specify the data value: custom-model-data:3 . To check that an item does not have custom model data set no-custom-model-data . Examples : name:&4Sword_made_of_Holy_Concrete name:none lore:&cOnly_this_sword_can_kill_the_Lord_Ruler lore:&2Quest_Item lore-containing lore:none enchants:damage_all:3+,none-knockback enchants:power:? enchants-containing enchants:none unbreakable unbreakable:false These are the arguments that can be applied only to specific item types:","title":"Items"},{"location":"Documentation/Reference/#books","text":"This applies to a written book and a book and quill. title - the title of a book.

All underscores will be replaced with spaces, you cannot use color codes here. If you want to specifically say that the book must not have any author, use none keyword. text - the text of the book. All underscores will be replaced with spaces and you can use & color codes. The text will wrap to the next page if amount of characters exceeds journal.chars_per_page setting in config.yml . If you want to manually wrap the page, use | character. To go to new line use \\n . Keep in mind that you can't use any spaces here, you must only use underscores ( _ ). This needs to be a single argument, even if it's really long. If you don't want the book to have any text, use none keyword instead.

It can be specified as extended or extended:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT extended, use extended:false . upgraded - upgraded property of the potion (you can achieve it in-game by adding glowstone). It can be specified as upgraded or upgraded:true . If you want to check the potion that is NOT upgraded, use upgraded:false . effects - a list of custom effects. These are independent of the potion type. The effects must be separated by commas. Each effect consists of these things, separated by colons: type (this is different stuff that the link above!) power duration (in seconds) An example would be WITHER:2:30 , which is a wither effect of level 2 for 30 seconds. If you want to target only potions without custom effects, use none keyword. You can target potions with level and time greater/less (and equal) than specified with + / - character after the number. If you don't care about the level/time, you can replace them with question mark. By default all specified effects are required. If you want to check if the potion contains these effects among others, add effects-containing argument to the instruction string. Now if you want to make sure the potion doesn't contain a specific effect, prefix the effect name with none- . Don't use that prefix unless you're also using effects-containing argument , it doesn't make any sense and it will break the check.

Note the separation characters, this is important: commas separate effects, colons separate effect properties, semicolons separate colors. If you want to target fireworks without any effects, use none keyword. If you want to target any effect type, use question mark instead of the effect name. If you don't want the effect to have any main/fade colors, use none keyword in the place of colors. If you don't care about main/fade colors, use question marks in that place.

The quest could be broken if the player loses them. Such an item wouldn't be dropped (on death), instead it would be placed in the player's backpack. You can add a specific line to an item's lore to make it persistent. It's &2Quest_Item ( _ is a space in an item's definition) if your default language is english. The translation of the line can be found in messages.yml if a different default language is configured. It's also possible to change the translation. Note that this must be an entirely new line in the lore! Example : important_sword : \"DIAMOND_SWORD name:Sword_for_destroying__The_Concrete lore:Made_of_pure_Mithril;&2Quest_Item\" To open your backpack just type /j command. The inventory window will open, displaying your stored items. The first slot is always the journal, and if you get it, the slot will stay empty. You can transfer quest items back and forth between inventories by clicking on them. Left click will transfer just one item, right click will try to transfer all items. Normal items cannot be stored into the backpack, so it's not an infinite inventory. If you will ever have more than one page of quest items, the buttons will appear. You can customize those buttons by creating previous_button and next_button items in items.yml file. Their name will be overwritten with the one defined in messages.yml . Quest items cannot be dropped in any way other than using them. This way you can create a quest for eating cookies by giving the player a stack of cookies flagged as quest items and not continuing until there are no more cookies in his inventory/backpack. The player cannot drop the cookies, so he must eat every one of them to complete the quest. Don't worry if the item-dropping filter isn't working for your items when you're in creative mode - it's not a bug. It's a feature.

So simple, that they are hard to understand if you already know some other party system. Basically, they don't even have to be created before using them. Parties are defined directly in conditions/events ( party event, party conditions, check them out in the reference lists below). In such instruction strings the first argument is a number - range. It defines the radius where the party members will be looked for. Second is a list of conditions. Only the players that meet those conditions will be considered as members of the party. It's most intuitive for players, as they don't have to do anything to be in a party - no commands, no GUIs, just starting the same quest or having the same item - you choose what and when makes the party. To understand better how it works I will show you an example of party event. Let's say that every player has an objective of pressing a button. When one of them presses it, this event is fired: party_reward : party 50 quest_started cancel_button,teleport_to_dungeon Now, it means that all players that: are in radius of 50 blocks around the player who pressed the button AND meet quest_started condition will receive cancel_button and teleport_to_dungeon events. The first one will cancel the quest for pressing the button for the others (it's no longer needed), the second one will teleport them somewhere. Now, imagine there is a player on the other side of the world who also meets quest_started condition - he won't be teleported into the dungeon, because he was not with the other players (not in 50 blocks range). Now, there were a bunch of other players running around the button, but they didn't meet the quest_started condition.

If the regex ends with square brackets you have to add another pair of empty square brackets even if you don't want to use the state argument ( [regex][] ).

This works by using the variable objective and the variable event. Expose conditions to 3 rd party plugins: condition \ud83d\udd17 You can expose BetonQuest's conditions to 3 rd party plugins by using the condition variable together with the PAPI support . The variable will return true or false by default. If you add papiMode to the instruction it will return yes or no . You can translate the papiMode's result by changing the values of condition_variable_met condition_variable_not_met in the messages.yml config. %condition.myCondition% %condition.myCondition.papiMode% Global point: globalpoint \ud83d\udd17 Works the same as normal point variable but instead of displaying points from a players category it displays points in a global, player independent category. Example %globalpoint.global_knownusers.left:100% Item: item \ud83d\udd17 With this variable you can display amount of specific items in player's inventory or a number needed to reach specific amount. The first argument is the name of an item (as defined in items.yml ) and the second one is either amount or left:x , where x is a number. Example %item.stick.amount% Location: location \ud83d\udd17 This variable resolves to all aspects of the player's location. The x, y and z coordinates, the world name, the yaw and pitch (head rotation). There are also modes for Betons Unified Location Formatting (ULF from now on) which means that this variable can also be used in events, conditions etc. If you just specify %location% the variables will resolve to a ULF with yaw and pitch. You can add two options to that base, one will give back parts of the ULF and the other will set to how many decimal places the variable will resolve. Example % location% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6 % location.xyz% # -> 325 121 814 % location.x% # -> 325 % location.y% # -> 121 % location.z% # -> 814 % location.yaw% # -> 12 % location.pitch% # -> 6 % location.world% # -> myWorldName % location.ulfShort% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName % location.ulfLong% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6 % location.x.2% # -> 325.16 % location.ulfLong.5% # -> 325.54268;121.32186;814.45824;myWorldName;12.0;6.0 Calculate mathematical expression: math.calc \ud83d\udd17 This variable allows you to perform a calculation based on other variables (for example point or objective variables) and resolves to the result of the specified calculation. The variable always starts with math.calc: , followed by the calculation which should be calculated. Supported operations are + , - , * , / and ^ . You can use ( ) and [ ] braces and also calculate absolute values with | | . But be careful, don't use absolute values in the command event as it splits the commands at every | and don't nest them without parenthesis ( |4*|3-5|| wont work, but |4*(|3-5|)| does). Additionally, you can use the round operator ~ to round everything left of it to the number of decimal digits given on the right. So 4+0.35~1 will produce 4.4 and 4.2~0 will produce 4 . To use variables in the calculation you have two options: First just write the variable, but without % around them; In cases where this doesn't work, e.g. if the variable contains mathematical operators, you can surround it with curly braces { } . Inside the curly braces you have to escape with \\ , so to have a \\ in your variable you need to write \\\\ , to have a } inside your variable you need to write \\} . Example %math.calc:100*(15-point.reputation.amount)% %math.calc:objective.kill_zombies.left/objective.kill_zombies.total*100~2% %math.calc:-{ph.myplugin_stragee+placeholder}% NPC: npc \ud83d\udd17 It's a very simple variable. It's replaced by the name of the NPC in player's language. Example %npc% Objective: objective \ud83d\udd17 Using this variable you can display a property of an objective. The first argument is an ID of the objective as defined in objectives.yml (not the type). Make sure that the player has this objective active or it will be replaced with nothing (\"\"). Second argument is the name of a property you want to display. All properties are described in \"Objectives List\" chapter. Example %objective.kill_zombies.left% Player: player \ud83d\udd17 This variable will be replaced with the name of the player. If you add display argument, it will use display name instead of real name. Example %player.display% Point: point \ud83d\udd17 This variable displays the amount of points you have in some category or amount of points you need to have to reach a number. The first argument is the name of a category and the second argument is either amount or left:x , where x is a number. Example %point.reputation.left:15% Version: version \ud83d\udd17 This variable displays the version of the plugin.

The x, y and z coordinates, the world name, the yaw and pitch (head rotation). There are also modes for Betons Unified Location Formatting (ULF from now on) which means that this variable can also be used in events, conditions etc. If you just specify %location% the variables will resolve to a ULF with yaw and pitch. You can add two options to that base, one will give back parts of the ULF and the other will set to how many decimal places the variable will resolve. Example % location% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6 % location.xyz% # -> 325 121 814 % location.x% # -> 325 % location.y% # -> 121 % location.z% # -> 814 % location.yaw% # -> 12 % location.pitch% # -> 6 % location.world% # -> myWorldName % location.ulfShort% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName % location.ulfLong% # -> 325;121;814;myWorldName;12;6 % location.x.2% # -> 325.16 % location.ulfLong.5% # -> 325.54268;121.32186;814.45824;myWorldName;12.0;6.0","title":"Location: location"},{"location":"Documentation/Variables-List/#calculate-mathematical-expression-mathcalc","text":"This variable allows you to perform a calculation based on other variables (for example point or objective variables) and resolves to the result of the specified calculation.

You can use ( ) and [ ] braces and also calculate absolute values with | | . But be careful, don't use absolute values in the command event as it splits the commands at every | and don't nest them without parenthesis ( |4*|3-5|| wont work, but |4*(|3-5|)| does). Additionally, you can use the round operator ~ to round everything left of it to the number of decimal digits given on the right. So 4+0.35~1 will produce 4.4 and 4.2~0 will produce 4 .

The advantage of using IntelliJ is that this guide contains some steps and the project contains some files that help to fulfill our requirements regarding code and documentation style. You can still use your preferred IDE, but then you need to check on your own that your changes fulfill our requirements. Installing IntelliJ \ud83d\udd17 First download IntelliJ and install it. After you installed IntelliJ, we recommend installing the plugin Save Actions . The plugin automatically formats code, organizes imports, adds final modifiers, and fulfils some other requirements we have. You don't need to configure that plugin, the project contains the configuration file. Check out the repository \ud83d\udd17 You need a Git installation to be able to check out code from GitHub. You can follow this guide if you don't know how to install Git. Then you should fork the BetonQuest repository to your own account on GitHub. After you have setup the IDE, clone the BetonQuest repository from your account. You can also directly clone the repository in IntelliJ . In case videos and images are missing after cloning We use Git LFS to store big files like media files, so you need to install that too. Once you have executed the file that you downloaded from the Git LFS website, just run git lfs install . Then use git lfs pull to actually download the files. Adding remote repository \ud83d\udd17 In IntelliJ click on Git in the left upper corner and then Manage Remotes... . In the new window you already see a remote called origin . This remote is your fork of BetonQuest. Now add a new repository with the name upstream and the url https://github.com/BetonQuest/BetonQuest.git . Building the Plugin jar \ud83d\udd17 You can build the plugin with Maven. Sometimes, IntelliJ auto-detects that BetonQuest is a Maven project. You can see a \"Maven\" tab on the right side of the editor if that's the case. Otherwise, do this: First, open the \"Project\" tab on the left site. Then right-click the pom.xml file in the projects root folder. Select \"Add as Maven Project\". To build the BetonQuest jar, you simply need to run mvn verify . You can do this from the command line or use IntelliJ's Maven tab (double-click on BetonQuest/Lifecycle/verify ). You can then find a BetonQuest.jar in the newly created folder /target/artifacts . Build speed up \ud83d\udd17 As BetonQuest has a lot of dependencies, the build can take a long lime, especially for the first build. You can speed this up with the following configuration, that downloads all dependencies from our own Repository Manager instead of searching through all repositories that are defined in the project. If you do not already have the file, create a new file in this location: <HOME DIRECTORY>\\.m2\\settings.xml . The home directory on Windows is C:\\Users\\<YOUR USER NAME> . Then adopt or copy the following into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 <settings xmlns= \"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\" xmlns:xsi= \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation= \"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd\" > <mirrors> <mirror> <id> BetonQuest-Mirror </id> <url> https://betonquest.org/nexus/repository/default/ </url> <mirrorOf> betonquest-papermc-repo,betonquest-enginehub-repo,betonquest-heroes-repo,betonquest-lumine-repo,betonquest-citizensnpcs-repo,betonquest-codemc-repo,betonquest-placeholderapi-repo,betonquest-dmulloy2-repo,betonquest-lichtspiele-repo,betonquest-elmakers-repo,betonquest-jitpack-repo,betonquest-sonatype-releases-repo,betonquest-sonatype-snapshots-repo </mirrorOf> </mirror> </mirrors> </settings> Build on Start \ud83d\udd17 The first build of a day can take a while, because every version gets re-checked once every day. This is the reason, why an automatic build on startup reduces the time of following builds. It is really worth it to set it up. In IntelliJ navigate to File/Settings/Tools/Startup Tasks click on the Add button and click Add New Config . Now select Maven , set a Name like BetonQuest Resolve Dependencies and write dependency:resolve into the field Command line . Then confirm with Ok twice. Now after starting IntelliJ the BetonQuest Resolve Dependencies task should run automatically. Building the Documentation \ud83d\udd17 Make sure Python3 is installed on your local system and added to the PATH environment variable. The Python installer allows you to do so with a checkbox called something like \"Add Python to environment variables\". You also need to install GTK , the easiest way is to use this GTK installer if you are on Windows. Install all other dependencies by entering pip install -r config/docs-requirements.txt in the terminal on the project's root directory. In case you are a material-mkdocs insider (paid premium version) Set your license key by executing set MKDOCS_MATERIAL_INSIDERS=LICENSE_KEY_HERE (Windows) in the terminal. Then run pip install -r config/docs-requirements-insiders.txt instead of docs-requirements.txt . See your changes live \ud83d\udd17 Run this command in IntelliJ's integrated terminal (at the bottom) to create a docs preview in your browser: mkdocs serve Then visit 127.0.0.1:8000 to make sure that everything works.

Do not repeat the heading for individual entries Added: * added new conversation style: Hologram * new conversation style: Hologram Mark events, objectives etc. names with ` around them. Here is a breakdown of what belongs in each section: Added Do not write what class or file was added, describe the feature you added. Added: - event `teleport` allows teleportation of players - Citizens event `movenpc` makes it possible to let a NPC walk to a specific location Changed Give qualified information that indicates what the user may have to be aware of. Do not write event x has now argument y - that is a new feature and belongs to Added . Only add to this section if there are changed behaviours . Changed: - event `teleport` now first checks if another plugin canceled the event - german translations have been updated Deprecated List things that have been marked for removal. Also mention possible replacements. Deprecated: - event `message` will be deleted, use the `notify` event instead - Minecraft recently replaced material ids with namespaces. Update your items accordingly, ids will stop working soon Removed After something has been marked for removal in the category Deprecated it will end up here eventually. Repeat possible replacements. Removed: - `message` event, use the `notify` event instead - old material syntax, use material namespaces instead Fixes Solved bugs are listed in this category. Let the users know what the bug did, so they know if they were affected. Mention if the fix changed a behaviour. Fixes: - event `notify` did not resolve variables correctly - Citizens event `movenpc` is now more robust combined with other events like `stopnpc` and `teleportnpc` - you may need to reduce the distance beetween waypoints Security If there was a security issue, you write it down here. It's nearly the same as the category Fixes . But if something can be abused to effect server security or performance, you keep the way how it can be abused secret.

This is done via a pull request on GitHub. A pull request basically is asking us to pull your changes into our codebase. Let's create one! Push your changes \ud83d\udd17 The first step is to push your changes to your fork on GitHub. You can do this using IntelliJ's Git integration . Creating a Pull Request \ud83d\udd17 There are three ways to create a pull request: If you recently pushed to your fork, you see a Create Pull Request hint on our repository page . You can go to the Pull Request page on our repository and click on New Pull Request . But then you need to click on Compare across Forks and then select your Head Repository . You can also click on New Pull Request in your fork, then it already compares it to the BetonQuest repository. Now give the pull request a short but meaningful title. Then add a description that indicates what you added, removed or changed. If there are related issues, link them with the keyword Closes #issue-id-here , so the issue is automatically closed when the pull request is merged. Reviewer's Checklist \ud83d\udd17 The list below contains typical problems that we will check during the review. Do not click any of these boxes on GitHub, we will do that. Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements. Did you... ... run Maven verify? The most basic check is Maven Verify . Run it in you IDE and make sure it succeeds! ... test your changes? Always test your changes in-game! Keep in mind, that there could be some special case in your code that needs to be tested specifically. ... update the changelog? Don't forget to add a changelog entry for every change you made. Read maintaining the changelog for more information. ... update the documentation? You need to adjust the documentation everytime you changed, added or removed any feature. Remember: Things that aren't documented don't exist to the user. There can also be other reasons why you should update the documentation, like writing a new tutorial or adjusting a bad example. ... adjust the ConfigUpdater? Currently not relevant. We are working on a new updater. ... solve all TODOs? You shouldn't have any TODOs in your code because it indicates that your code is not finished. Unfinished code is not added to the plugin. Let's see what to do with different types of TODOs / comments: FIXME : Delete it -> Fix it or open an issue on GutHub. DEPRECATED : Delete it -> Deprecate with @Deprecated and document it in the Javadocs. Auto-generated code : Delete it. NOT IMPLEMENTED : Delete it -> Implement or leave empty. ... remove any commented out code? We use the version control system Git - it will remember any code.

In order to understand this, you need to have basic knowledge of JUnit tests and mocking of objects and classes. Introduction \ud83d\udd17 It is a major goal to write JUnit tests for most parts of BetonQuest. There are things, where you definitely want as many tests as possible: API Utilities Internal application logic that is used by a bunch of other code Critical parts that can cause a lot of harm when bugged But there are also some parts, where we do not want tests at all: If a core API concept has many implementations, the implementations itself should not be tested Some parts of the code require a lot of Bukkit API mocking. If this takes too much time no tests are necessary Handling Concurrency By default, all classes and methods are executed CONCURRENT . This means that its tests are run in parallel which saves time. Some tests cannot be executed in parallel, in such cases the following annotation needs to be added to the related methods or the entire class. 1 @Execution ( ExecutionMode . SAME_THREAD ) Handling Logging \ud83d\udd17 You may need to read Logging to understand this paragraph. This error can occur everytime the @CustomLog annotation is used in a class that is called by a JUnit test: Cannot invoke \"org.bukkit.Server.getPluginManager()\" because \"org.bukkit.Bukkit.server\" is null If this is the case, you need the BetonQuestLoggerService . Simply add the following annotation to the class: 1 2 @ExtendWith ( BetonQuestLoggerService . class ) public class TestFeature { The test should now work as intended because a new anonymous logger is created everytime the @CustomLog annotation is used. All these loggers have a silent parent logger - so there are no visible log messages in the command line. The BetonQuestLoggerService also enables a few new features: LogValidator \ud83d\udd17 You can now add this optional argument to any test's method signature: 1 2 3 4 5 @ExtendWith ( BetonQuestLoggerService . class ) public class TestFeature { @Test public void testCustom ( LogValidator validator ) { The LogValidator is created and passed to your method by the BetonQuestLoggerService . It makes it possible to assert that a log message has been logged in the silent parent logger. The simplest method is assertLogEntry(Level level, String message) , that you can use to check that the given message with the given level has been logged. You can also check that there are no additional log messages in the LogValidator by calling assertEmpty() . Use ExecutionMode.SAME_THREAD When using the LogValidator , you validate that log messages are logged in the correct order. This means that if you leave the ExecutionMode on its default ( CONCURRENT ) value, the test will fail. This happens because the log messages don't have a predictable order as your tests would be executed in parallel. 1 @Execution ( ExecutionMode . SAME_THREAD ) Advanced Features \ud83d\udd17 Obtaining the parent Logger and a BetonQuestLogger You can also use these two additional arguments: 1 2 3 4 5 @ExtendWith ( BetonQuestLoggerService . class ) public class TestFeature { @Test public void testCustom ( LogValidator validator , Logger logger , BetonQuestLogger log ) { The logger is the silent parent Logger .

Strive for consistency. Documentation should be as consistent as possible. This enables users to apply familiar structures (e.g. the structure of explanations) to new topics in the documentation. Write for a global audience. A global audience does not share the same cultural background. That's why you should avoid references to things that are unique to your culture. Example: The Australian summer season starts in december. This is also true for certain words or patterns in your language: Foo and Bar as synonyms for \"example words\" are likely unknown to non-native speakers and translation software. Take a look at the Microsoft Style Guide for Global Communications to learn more. Write for non-native speakers. Users from all over the world will read this documentation. Most of them are not native speakers, some even use translators. Simple language should be used to make sure everyone can understand the documentation. Write for beginners and masters alike. Your audience contains people with all kinds of skill levels - this is true for both BetonQuest skills but also for general computer skills. Try to find common ground between these two. New users must still be able to understand your documentation while more experienced users shouldn't be bored by the same explanations over and over again. One great way to do this is by providing optional context through links to other pages. Write documentation about features, not code. Users will have a hard time understanding features that are explained in technical terms. Describe what a feature does not how it works . The same is true for feature names.","title":"\u2712\ufe0f Fundamental Principles"},{"location":"Tutorials/Frequently-Asked-Questions/","text":"FAQ \ud83d\udd17 If you have any questions please read this page first. You can easily look for your questions using the table of contents to the right. It's very likely that it has been already asked and answered. If not, feel free to ask us in the discord !. Where is the command for creating quests? \ud83d\udd17 There is no such command. BetonQuest is too complex to edit it using commands or chest GUI's. We have a VSCode addon to make editing easier. Can you add particles over NPCs' heads like in \"Quests\" plugin? \ud83d\udd17 Yes! Check out the EffectLib compatibility documentation. Can I assign multiple conversation files to one NPC? \ud83d\udd17 No. You can use cross-conversation-pointers though. Can I delete all tags from a player at once? \ud83d\udd17 No. You either need to run all /q t del PLAYER PACKAGE.TAG commands, or you can use /q purge PLAYER to reset an entire player profile. If you want this as a scripted part of your quest however: Either use a folder event that holds all tag-deleting events. Or use a run event in which you specify all tag-deleting events at once. (We will improve this don't worry) How do I start an objective from a conversation? \ud83d\udd17 Use the objective event . Why is X thing not working? \ud83d\udd17 If something stopped working before asking for help please do /q reload and READ THE OUTPUT IN CONSOLE! You will be able to see which events etc. loaded and which didn't with the reasons why. You may be able to fix it yourself from this or use this information, so we can better help you! Also double check you saved your files and if needed reupload them to your server. This is insanely common and can be overlooked! I have an error which says \"Cannot load plugins/BetonQuest/{someFile}.yml\", what is wrong? \ud83d\udd17 You have incorrect YAML syntax in your conversation file. Usually it's because you started a line with ! or & , forgot colons or made some weird things with apostrophes. How to get a formatted version of the BlockObjective's variables? \ud83d\udd17 The math variable is perfect for this. /papi parse USER %betonquest_BlockVar:math.calc:|objective.test.left|% How to display \"1 / 10\" in objective notify \ud83d\udd17 This problem can be solved by scripting a small custom message system. The core ideas of that system are: An objective always has an amount of 1 as we want to show a message upon each progression towards our goal. The objective instantly restarts after it is finished thanks to the persistent argument. It will be deleted using the objective event once it's finished. The systems logic is essentially just a point variable that is increased on each completion and a notify event being run. That notify event displays a the current objective progress. The objective gets reset with an event that has a condition bound to it. That means that the event will only be run once the condition is true. in this case the player needs 10 points / needs to have mined 10 blocks. Here is an example for the block objective. #objectives.yml mineStone : \"block stone -1 persistent events:blockBroken\" #events.yml blockBroken : \"folder addPoint,sendNotify,checkForCompletion\" addPoint : \"point blockCounter 1\" sendNotify : \"notify &a%point.blockCounter.amount%&8/&210 &7stone broken. io:chat\" checkForCompletion : \"run ^objective remove mineStone ^deletepoint blockCounter conditions:has10Points\" #conditions.yml has10Points : \"point blockCounter 10\" How can I let the NPC say things across multiple lines? \ud83d\udd17 You need to use the PIPE | character at the start of the multiline string. text : | This is line one. This is line two. You can also format this using spaces. How to deal with unresolvable variables that show \"0\"? \ud83d\udd17 You can just add them together using math.calc . %math.calc:objective.PickWheat1.left+objective.PickWheat2.left+objective.PickWheat3.left+objective.PickWheat4.left' How to match different items with just one condition? \ud83d\udd17 If you want a player to have e.g. potato + poisonous_potato = 64 in his inventory you can make a special item in your items.yml file that matches items based of their names. More specifically, you can have a Block Selector that is a regex . It would look like this in the example: #items.yml anyPotato : \".*potato.*\" #conditions.yml hasAnyPotato : \"item anyPotato\" How to store custom text in a variable / How to use the variable objective? \ud83d\udd17 Start a variable objective for the player. It serves as a variable storage: #objectives.yml myVariableStorage : \"variable no-chat\" Assign values to that storage using a key and a value. Both can be any text you like: #events.yml addBlock : \"variable myVariableStorage blockName REDSTONE\" addLocation : \"variable myVariableStorage location 123;456;789;world\" Read from your variable storage using the storages name and the data key. #conditions.yml hasHeartBlock : \"testforblock %objective.myVariableStorage.location% %objective.myVariableStorage.blockName%\" Error \"Quester is not defined\" \ud83d\udd17 You either actually did not define the quester: someName option at the top of your conversation, or your YAML syntax is invalid. YAML Syntax Errors are the HUGE red lines that you see when you do /q reload. They lead to the file not being properly read -> All kinds of errors like \"can't find quester etc.\" Copy your file into http://www.yamllint.com/ to confirm that it is actually a YAML error and fix your syntax. Best practise is to define all options like this: myOptionName: \"myData\" The double quotes prevent YAMl issues with e.g. ! . Other plugins override BetonQuest commands / BetonQuest overrides other commands! \ud83d\udd17 You can change which command is used using a Bukkit feature: https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Commands.yml Handling death in your quests \ud83d\udd17 Sometimes, while writing a dangerous quest you will want something specific to happen when the player dies. If it's a boss battle you may want to fail the quest, if it's a dungeon you may want to respawn the player at the beginning of a level etc. You can do that with die objective - simply start it for the player at the beginning of the quest and make it fire events that will do the thing you want (like teleporting the player to desired respawn point, removing tags set during the quest etc). You can add persistent argument to the objective instruction string to make it active even after completing it. Remember to delete it after the quest is done! Creating regions for one player at the time \ud83d\udd17 Imagine you have a room to which the player is teleported. Then suddenly mobs start to spawn and the player must kill them (because it's a trap or something). The player has killed all the mobs, he got a tag and wants to proceed but all of the sudden another player teleports into the room and all the mobs start to spawn again. The first player is quickly killed and the second one easily kills all mobs. You can prevent such situations by using party condition. Just check with it if the party consisting of \"players inside the room\" has greater amount of players that 1. Set the range to something big enough so it covers the room and the party condition can be tag or location. Racing with folder event \ud83d\udd17 Since folder event can run tag events even for offline players you can create races. Create location objective where you want the finish line to be and condition it with negated \"race_failed\" tag (or similar). It will mean that \"if the player has not failed the race, he can win it by reaching the location\". Now when the race starts fire folder event with the amount of time you want to give your players to complete the race. This event should set \"race_failed\" tag. If the player reaches the location before this tag is set, he will fire all events in that location objective, but if the time has passed, the objective will not be completed. You can figure the rest out for yourself. Random daily quests \ud83d\udd17 Starting the random quest must be blocked with a special tag. If there is no such tag, the conversation option should appear. Create a few quests, each of them started with single folder event (they must be started by single event!). Now add those events to another folder event and make it random:1 . At the end of every quest add delay which will reset the special blocking tag. Now add that folder event to the conversation option. When the player chooses it he will start one random quest, and the conversation option will become available after defined in delay objective time after completing the quest. The same random daily quest for every player \ud83d\udd17 To do this use something called \" Static event \". Run a static folder event every day at some late hour (for example 4am). The folder event should be random:1 and contain several different globaltag events. These events will set a specific tag. Now when the player starts the conversation and asks about the daily quest the NPC should check (using the globaltag condition) which tag is currently set and give the player different quests based on that. Of course, the static folder event also needs to remove the the current tag before setting a new one. Global Quests (all players work together) \ud83d\udd17 There is no easy way to do this (yet). Additionally, every use case differs. Let's assume you have some sort of event on your server where your player's need to fish 100 salmons. The quest package is only installed during the event. Create an objective that is immediately fired upon the first interaction (this means setting the amount to one for most objectives). That objective must be persistent so it restarts immediately upon completion. It also has to be global so every player will receive it upon joining the server. # fish a salmon to progress the global quest gQuest : fish SALMON 1 events:gQuestProgress global persistent The objective would trigger a folder event that increases a globalpoint variable by one and tries to run the events that are fired upon completion. That globalpoint variable tracks the players combined progress. The \"completion events\" must be limited by a globalpoint condition that checks whether the globalpoint variable has reached a certain value. events.yml # 1. increase the global variable 2. wait one tick for the change to process 3. attempt to run the completion events gQuestProgress : folder gQuestIncrementCounter,gQuestCheckCompletion period:1 ticks # Adds 1 to the global variable gQuestIncrementCounter : globalpoint gQuest 1 # Runs completion events only when the condition is met (= the global variable reached X points) gQuestCheckCompletion : folder gQuestNotify,gQuestOnCompletion,gDeleteObjective condition:gQuestComplete # Deletes the objective from everyone that fished a salmon after the goal was met qDeleteObjective : \"objective delete gQuest\" conditions.yml # Complete at one hundred collected gquest_complete : globalpoint gquest 100 Downsides to this approach: Only the player that fished the final salmon (number 100) will get the reward immediately. All other players need to fish an additional salmon to trigger the completion logic. Therefore a central NPC that also gives out rewards and shows the progress is recommended. Since some players logged off during the event while still having the objective, a clean-up package should be installed after the event. It will remove the objective from them - this is important as BetonQuest will complain about objectives that are still active for a player but are not referenced in any quest package. This will happen since you have to remove the event package after the event. Such a package holds the original objective and clean-up objective: objectives.yml # Old objective just without global & persistent to make sure no one get's it automatically gQuest : fish SALMON 1 events:gQuestProgress # Cleanup objective that is immediately completed when someone joins login events:deleteOldObjective global events.yml # Deletes the old objective from the current player deleteOldObjective : \"objective delete gQuest\" Make the NPC react randomly \ud83d\udd17 Imagine you want to lie to NPC and he has 15% chance of believing you completely, 35% of being suspicious and 50% of not believing at all. The common denominator for those percentages is 20, so we can write it as 3/20, 7/20 and 10/20. The NPC will check options one after another until it finds one which meets all conditions. We will use random condition with our options. The first one will have 3-20 chance (that's the format used by random condition). If this condition fails, the NPC will check next option. But it won't be 7-20 , because we already \"used\" 3 of 20. If you wrote it like that, the chance would be too low. That's why it will be 7-17 . The third option should have 10-10 (because 17 - 7 = 10 and 50% is 10/20), but as you can see it will always be true. It's because we want the last option to be shown if both previous fail. You don't have to add the last condition at all. Quest GUI \ud83d\udd17 If you want your players to be able to choose a quest everywhere, every time, then you can create a conversation which can be started with an item. This one is a little hacky but it shows flexibility of BetonQuest. First you need a conversation which behaves as a quest choosing GUI. Name the NPC \"Quester\", add one option for each quest etc. Now you need an objective which will start this conversation using conversation event. It should be action objective, set to right click on any block. Add hand condition to make it accept only clicks with a specific item and make the objective persistent (so players can use it multiple times). The item used here should be marked as Quest Item so players can't drop it. Now define new global location covering your whole map and using it start the objective and give players the item. This way all players (existing and new) will get the quest item, which opens a GUI with quests when right clicked.","title":"\ud83e\udd14 \u200aGeneral FAQ"},{"location":"Tutorials/Frequently-Asked-Questions/#faq","text":"If you have any questions please read this page first.

The \"completion events\" must be limited by a globalpoint condition that checks whether the globalpoint variable has reached a certain value. events.yml # 1. increase the global variable 2. wait one tick for the change to process 3. attempt to run the completion events gQuestProgress : folder gQuestIncrementCounter,gQuestCheckCompletion period:1 ticks # Adds 1 to the global variable gQuestIncrementCounter : globalpoint gQuest 1 # Runs completion events only when the condition is met (= the global variable reached X points) gQuestCheckCompletion : folder gQuestNotify,gQuestOnCompletion,gDeleteObjective condition:gQuestComplete # Deletes the objective from everyone that fished a salmon after the goal was met qDeleteObjective : \"objective delete gQuest\" conditions.yml # Complete at one hundred collected gquest_complete : globalpoint gquest 100 Downsides to this approach: Only the player that fished the final salmon (number 100) will get the reward immediately. All other players need to fish an additional salmon to trigger the completion logic. Therefore a central NPC that also gives out rewards and shows the progress is recommended. Since some players logged off during the event while still having the objective, a clean-up package should be installed after the event. It will remove the objective from them - this is important as BetonQuest will complain about objectives that are still active for a player but are not referenced in any quest package. This will happen since you have to remove the event package after the event. Such a package holds the original objective and clean-up objective: objectives.yml # Old objective just without global & persistent to make sure no one get's it automatically gQuest : fish SALMON 1 events:gQuestProgress # Cleanup objective that is immediately completed when someone joins login events:deleteOldObjective global events.yml # Deletes the old objective from the current player deleteOldObjective : \"objective delete gQuest\"","title":"Global Quests (all players work together)"},{"location":"Tutorials/Frequently-Asked-Questions/#make-the-npc-react-randomly","text":"Imagine you want to lie to NPC and he has 15% chance of believing you completely, 35% of being suspicious and 50% of not believing at all. The common denominator for those percentages is 20, so we can write it as 3/20, 7/20 and 10/20. The NPC will check options one after another until it finds one which meets all conditions. We will use random condition with our options. The first one will have 3-20 chance (that's the format used by random condition). If this condition fails, the NPC will check next option. But it won't be 7-20 , because we already \"used\" 3 of 20. If you wrote it like that, the chance would be too low. That's why it will be 7-17 . The third option should have 10-10 (because 17 - 7 = 10 and 50% is 10/20), but as you can see it will always be true. It's because we want the last option to be shown if both previous fail.

Quick-Start-Tutorial: Provides a brief overview about the building blocks. Recommended for experienced plugin scripters and programmers. Full beginner guide Quick start tutorial Checking out the \"default\" example quest. \ud83d\udd17 Let's start by checking out the build in example quest. You can find it in the BetonQuest directory that has been generated in your plugins folder. The folder you are looking for is named \" default \". Open it up and find a file called main.yml . It contains a lot of options, but you only need to look at this section: 1 2 npcs : '0' : innkeeper You will need to change the '0' to the ID of the Citizens NPC you want to learn Beton with. You obtain a NPC's ID by selecting it with /npc sel while looking at it and then running /npc id . Execute /q reload and right-click the NPC. The conversation should start. If it did not, check if you correctly assigned the ID. Ask the Innkeeper for some quests. He will tell you to cut some trees. If you want, type /journal to get the journal and see a new entry. Now, don't try to place any wood blocks. BetonQuest will detect that and increase the number of blocks to destroy. Just go and find some trees that you can cut down. Now you can return to the Innkeeper and give him the wood. You will receive the reward. Using events and conditions \ud83d\udd17 Now that you know how a (very) simple quest looks like time to start learning how to write something similar. Let's start with events. We won't do conversations just now, since they heavily use events and conditions, so you need to know them first. You can read complete reference to events in the Reference chapter . Do that now or just continue with this tutorial. Events \ud83d\udd17 Let's just open events.yml file inside the default package. Add a new line at the bottom: 1 mega : \"notify Hello world!\" This is an event instruction. BetonQuest will use it to determine what type of event is used and what exactly it should do. mega is the event's name, notify is the events type and Hello world! tells the notify event what it needs to display. In this case, if you run mega event, it will display Hello world! as a chat message. Now save the file, issue /q reload command and run the event with /q e {name} default.mega command ( q is shortcut for quest , e is shortcut for event , {name} is your Minecraft name without the brackets, default is the package/quest and mega is the name of the event we've just created). It should show you a Hello world! notification in the chat. Let's create another event, a more complicated one. teleport seems complicated enough. As you can read in the Events list , it needs a single argument, the location. Press F3 and check out your current location (it's shown on the left, three numbers, x , y and z ). Now add in events.yml another line: 1 tp : \"teleport 100;200;300;world\" and replace 100 with your x coordinate, 200 with y and 300 with z . world needs to be replaced with your current world's name. Save the file, reload the plugin ( /q reload ) and run this event with a command described before. It should teleport you to the location you have specified. Congratulations, you have just created your first events. Go ahead and do some experiments with other event types. You can find them in Events list chapter. Once you're done let's start learning conditions. Conditions \ud83d\udd17 Open the conditions.yml file and add a new line: 1 mega : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" Can you see how we named the mega condition in the same way as the mega event? They are not connected in any way. Condition names and event names are separated, so you can give them the same name without any problems. Now let's look at the instruction string. As you can suspect, location is a type of the condition. This one means that we'll be checking if the player is near that location (you should change the location to the place where you're standing right now, so you don't have to run around the world). Note that at the end of location argument there is an additional number, 5 . This is the maximum distance you can be away from the location to meet the condition. Alright, save the file and reload the plugin. Now walk to the location you have defined in the condition. Try to stand on the exact block corresponding to that location. Issue /q c {name} default.mega command ( c is shortcut for condition ). It should show you \"Condition blah blah blah: true \". We're focusing on that last word, true . This means that you're meeting the condition: you're standing within 5 block radius of the location. Now move 2 blocks away and issue that command again. You should still be meeting the condition. Walk 4 more blocks away and try now. It should show false . You are now outside of that 5 block radius. Get it? Great. Now I'll show you the simplest use of those conditions. Open the events.yml file again, and at the end of mega instruction add conditions:mega argument. By the way, rename your events to something that actually fits the type of the event, otherwise it will get confusing really fast. Example: events.yml # This is a comment btw # Old: mega : \"notify Hello world!\" # New: sayHello : \"notify Hello world! conditions:isAtSpawn\" conditions.yml # Old: mega : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" # New: isAtSpawn : \"location 100;200;300;world 5\" Now sayHello event will run only if it meets isAtSpawn condition. Reload the plugin, walk outside of the 5 block radius and try to run sayHello event. Puff, nothing happens. It's because you're not meeting isAtSpawn condition. Walk into the radius again and try to run that event now. It should happily display the Hello world! notification. It's very nice that we can add such conditions, but the problem is: what if you wanted to display the notification only if the player is outside the radius? Don't worry, you don't have to specify inverted_location condition or anything like that. You can simply negate the condition. Negation makes the condition behave in the exact opposite way, in this case it isAtSpawn will be met only if the player is outside of the 5 block radius, and it won't be met if he's inside. Open the events.yml and add an exclamation mark before the isAtSpawn condition, so it looks like this: 1 sayHello : \"notify Hello world! conditions:!isAtSpawn\" This means \"display the Hello world! notification if the isAtSpawn condition is not met \". Save the file, reload the plugin and run the event inside and outside of the radius to see how it works. Basic tags \ud83d\udd17 Now that you know how to use events and conditions I'll show you what tags are. Create new events: 1 2 add_beton_tag : \"tag add beton\" del_beton_tag : \"tag del beton\" It's a good practice to give your events names that describe what they are doing. Imagine you have 100 events, foo24 , bar65 , baz12 etc. You would get lost pretty quickly. So, add_beton_tag event here simply adds beton tag to the player, del_beton_tag removes it. Save the file, reload the plugin and run this event. Nothing happens... or does it? Issue /q t {name} command ( t is shortcut for tags ). It should show you a list with few entries. Right now focus on default.beton , the rest are used by the default quest for Innkeeper. Alright, default is the name of the package in which the tag is, and beton is the name of the tag, as defined in add_beton_tag event. Now run del_beton_tag event. Guess what, default.beton disappeared from the list! And that's it, you know how to add and remove tags. Pretty useless. Nothing could be more wrong. Tags are one the most powerful things in BetonQuest. They just need to be used with tag condition. Open conditions.yml and add 1 has_beton_tag : \"tag beton\" line. As you can imagine, tag is the type of condition (the same as tag event, but these are not the same things - one is an event, the other one is a condition) and beton is the name of the tag. You don't have to specify default.beton , but you can if you want. Now save, reload and check it with a command. It should show false , since you have removed the tag with del_beton_tag event. Add it again with add_beton_tag event and check the has_beton_tag condition again. Now it will show true . Now you probably understand how powerful this system is. You could for example set a tag on the first time the player talks with an NPC, and if the NPC sees that tag next time they talk, he will tell something different, like \"welcome back\". Creating objectives \ud83d\udd17 Time to write some objectives! Open the objectives.yml file and add a new line: 1 kill_creepers : \"mobkill CREEPER 3 events:tp conditions:has_beton_tag\" Now let's analyze it. kill_creepers is a name of the objective. mobkill is a type. In this case, to complete the objective the player will have to kill some mobs. creeper is a type of the mob, so we know that these mobs will have to be Creepers. 3 is the amount. It means that the player has to kill 3 Creepers. events:tp means than once the player kills those Creepers, the tp event will be run. conditions:has_beton_tag tells us that the player will have to have beton tag while killing Creepers to complete the objective. Save it, reload the plugin and issue /q o {name} add default.kill_creepers command ( o is for objective , add tells the plugin to add an objective). Now you can check if you actually have this objective with /q o {name} command, it will show you all your active objectives. It should show default.kill_creepers . Alright, remove (yes, remove!) the beton tag from you and find some Creepers to kill. Once you killes 3 of them you will notice that nothing happened. It's because has_beton_tag condtion is not met, so the objective does not count your progress. Now add the tag again and kill another Creepers. When the third is dead you should be teleported to the location defined in tp event. Congratulations, now you know how to use objectives. You should experiment with other types now, since objectives will be used very often in your quests. Once you're done check out the Writing your first conversation chapter to use your knowledge to write your fisrt conversation. Writing your first conversation \ud83d\udd17 Now that you have seen BetonQuest in action and understood events, conditions and objectives, it's time for writing your first conversation. There's a conversations directory inside the default package. It contains a single file, innkeeper.yml . This is the conversation with Innkeeper, the one who asks you to cut some trees. Open it, we'll use that for reference. Now create a new file, let's say miner.yml . Now type (don't copy-paste it, you'll learn better while typing) that into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 quester : Miner first : greeting NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! It's the most basic conversation possible. The NPC named Miner upon starting the conversation will use greeting option, which means he will say Hi there, traveler! . Then the conversation will end, because there are no player options defined. Now you need to link the conversation with an NPC. For that you now need to create or select another NPC. Then you link your conversation to the npc in the main.yml file. Open it now. As you can see the previous NPC conversation is linked to Innkeeper word. Now add another line under the Innkeeper: '1': miner , save the file and reload the server. This will link our new conversation with the NPC with the id \"1\". Now click on that NPC. Guess what, the conversation finished right after it started. The Miner just said Hi there, traveler! , as expected. Now go to the conversation file and edit it (again, manually, no copy-paste!) so the options look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello,bye player_options : hello : text : Hello! bye : text : I need to go, sorry. When you save the file, reload the plugin and start the conversation again you will notice that there are two options for you to choose: Hello! and I need to go, sorry. Choosing any of them will end the conversation, because these options did not specify any pointers. Now add a new NPC option, for example weather with text Nice weather. and make hello player option point to it. When you save&reload, the Miner should say Nice weather. when you tell him Hello! . I think you get how it works. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello,bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now, every time you talk to the Miner, he will say the same thing. It would be nice if the second time you talk to him he knew your name. We can do that with tags. Define a meet_miner event and has_met_miner condition. When you talk to the Miner for the first time, he will check if you have met him. If not, he will meet you (with that event) and next time you talk, the condition will be passed and he will use your name. Now, rename greeting NPC option to first_greeting . Add meet_miner event and negated has_met_miner condition (negated because this option should only show if the player has not met the Miner yet). You will need to surround the condition with '' , because strings cannot start with exclamation marks in YAML. It should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 first : first_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello,bye This means: first_greeting should be used if the player does not pass has_met_miner condition (meaning he doesn't have a tag because he haven't talked to the NPC yet). When this option is used, it will fire meet_miner event and display hello and bye options. Alright, but what happens if the player met the Miner and now negated has_met_miner condition doesn't work? NPC will try to use next option defined in first setting. There is none yet, so let's add it. 1 2 3 4 5 first : first_greeting,regular_greeting NPC_options : regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello,bye This option does not have any conditions, so if the first_greeting fails, the NPC will always choose this one. Now take a look at the %player% thing. It's a variable. In this place it will show your name. There are more than this one, they are described in Reference chapter. Alright, save&reload and start the conversation. If you did everything correctly, the Miner should greet you as a \"traveler\", and the second time you talk to him, he should greet you with your Minecraft name. Here's the whole conversation you created, so you can check if you understood everything correctly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 first : first_greeting,regular_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello,bye regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello,bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now you should experiment some more with this conversation, you can help yourself by looking at the innkeeper.yml file. Try to understand how that conversation works step by step. As the excercise you should complete the Miner NPC, so he asks you to mine some iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace, next craft an armor with it and return to him wearing this armor. You might want to check out the Reference chapter to see how to handle items in your quests and how to add entries to the journal. If you want to use Citizens NPCs instead of the ones made with clay you will find information you need in that chapter too. To find out more about events, conditions, objectives and variables, take a look at the appropriate lists (after the Reference chapter).","title":"\ud83c\udf93 Learn BetonQuest"},{"location":"Tutorials/Getting-Started/Learn-BetonQuest/#checking-out-the-default-example-quest","text":"Let's start by checking out the build in example quest.

Alright, remove (yes, remove!) the beton tag from you and find some Creepers to kill. Once you killes 3 of them you will notice that nothing happened. It's because has_beton_tag condtion is not met, so the objective does not count your progress. Now add the tag again and kill another Creepers. When the third is dead you should be teleported to the location defined in tp event. Congratulations, now you know how to use objectives. You should experiment with other types now, since objectives will be used very often in your quests. Once you're done check out the Writing your first conversation chapter to use your knowledge to write your fisrt conversation.","title":"Creating objectives"},{"location":"Tutorials/Getting-Started/Learn-BetonQuest/#writing-your-first-conversation","text":"Now that you have seen BetonQuest in action and understood events, conditions and objectives, it's time for writing your first conversation. There's a conversations directory inside the default package. It contains a single file, innkeeper.yml . This is the conversation with Innkeeper, the one who asks you to cut some trees. Open it, we'll use that for reference. Now create a new file, let's say miner.yml . Now type (don't copy-paste it, you'll learn better while typing) that into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 quester : Miner first : greeting NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! It's the most basic conversation possible. The NPC named Miner upon starting the conversation will use greeting option, which means he will say Hi there, traveler! . Then the conversation will end, because there are no player options defined. Now you need to link the conversation with an NPC. For that you now need to create or select another NPC. Then you link your conversation to the npc in the main.yml file. Open it now. As you can see the previous NPC conversation is linked to Innkeeper word. Now add another line under the Innkeeper: '1': miner , save the file and reload the server. This will link our new conversation with the NPC with the id \"1\". Now click on that NPC. Guess what, the conversation finished right after it started. The Miner just said Hi there, traveler! , as expected. Now go to the conversation file and edit it (again, manually, no copy-paste!) so the options look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello,bye player_options : hello : text : Hello! bye : text : I need to go, sorry. When you save the file, reload the plugin and start the conversation again you will notice that there are two options for you to choose: Hello! and I need to go, sorry. Choosing any of them will end the conversation, because these options did not specify any pointers. Now add a new NPC option, for example weather with text Nice weather. and make hello player option point to it. When you save&reload, the Miner should say Nice weather. when you tell him Hello! . I think you get how it works. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 NPC_options : greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! pointers : hello,bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now, every time you talk to the Miner, he will say the same thing. It would be nice if the second time you talk to him he knew your name. We can do that with tags. Define a meet_miner event and has_met_miner condition. When you talk to the Miner for the first time, he will check if you have met him. If not, he will meet you (with that event) and next time you talk, the condition will be passed and he will use your name. Now, rename greeting NPC option to first_greeting . Add meet_miner event and negated has_met_miner condition (negated because this option should only show if the player has not met the Miner yet). You will need to surround the condition with '' , because strings cannot start with exclamation marks in YAML. It should look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 first : first_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello,bye This means: first_greeting should be used if the player does not pass has_met_miner condition (meaning he doesn't have a tag because he haven't talked to the NPC yet). When this option is used, it will fire meet_miner event and display hello and bye options. Alright, but what happens if the player met the Miner and now negated has_met_miner condition doesn't work? NPC will try to use next option defined in first setting. There is none yet, so let's add it. 1 2 3 4 5 first : first_greeting,regular_greeting NPC_options : regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello,bye This option does not have any conditions, so if the first_greeting fails, the NPC will always choose this one. Now take a look at the %player% thing. It's a variable. In this place it will show your name. There are more than this one, they are described in Reference chapter. Alright, save&reload and start the conversation. If you did everything correctly, the Miner should greet you as a \"traveler\", and the second time you talk to him, he should greet you with your Minecraft name. Here's the whole conversation you created, so you can check if you understood everything correctly: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 first : first_greeting,regular_greeting NPC_options : first_greeting : text : Hi there, traveler! condition : '!has_met_miner' event : meet_miner pointers : hello,bye regular_greeting : text : Hi %player%! pointers : hello,bye weather : text : Nice weather. player_options : hello : text : Hello! pointer : weather bye : text : I need to go, sorry. Now you should experiment some more with this conversation, you can help yourself by looking at the innkeeper.yml file. Try to understand how that conversation works step by step. As the excercise you should complete the Miner NPC, so he asks you to mine some iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace, next craft an armor with it and return to him wearing this armor. You might want to check out the Reference chapter to see how to handle items in your quests and how to add entries to the journal. If you want to use Citizens NPCs instead of the ones made with clay you will find information you need in that chapter too. To find out more about events, conditions, objectives and variables, take a look at the appropriate lists (after the Reference chapter).","title":"Writing your first conversation"},{"location":"Tutorials/Getting-Started/Setting-up-a-local-test-server/","text":"Setting up a local test server \ud83d\udd17 Why do I need a local server?! \ud83d\udd17 You might think that a local test server is useless because you already have a remote server. There are multiple reasons why you really need one: Working on a live server could lead to crashes and bugs that your players will have to deal with. Making quests can, especially for new questers, lead to unexpected behavior. This can be anything from spawning hundreds of mobs to endlessly giving out items to a player. Exactly the stuff you don't want to happen. Working with a test server is usually faster and therefore more productive. You can restart it all the time, change plugin configurations as you wish etc. Setup of your local server \ud83d\udd17 Step 1: You have propably heard of Spigot, the biggest server software for Minecraft. We are going to install Paper (an improved version of Spigot) on your computer. Head over to Papers download page and click on the button you see in the image below (the numbers will not match up, ignore that). Step 2: Create a new folder for the server in a place you can easily access. Making a new folder is important because the server will create a lot of files that would mess up your Desktop etc. Move the downloaded file in the newly created folder. If the file's name is something like \"paper-X.YY.Z-100\" rename it to paper . If the name contains a \".jar\" ending just change the part in front of the ending to paper . Example: paper-X.YY.Z-100 -> paper paper-X.YY.Z-100.jar -> paper.jar Step 3: You need a start script to start your server. Open your text editor and create a file named start.bat (For Linux and Mac: Create a start.sh file instead). Place it in the freshly created folder. Open it and copy this into it: java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar paper.jar --nogui pause This script tells java to search for a file named paper.jar . The 1G setting in both the -Xms and -Xmx options is how much RAM you want to give to the server ( 1G = 1 GigaByte RAM, 2G = 2 GigaByte RAM, 700M for 700 MegaBytes, etc.). You should not need more then 1GB in most cases though. Make sure to save it as a .bat file! If you save it as a .txt file it will not work. Step 4: Start the server by double-clicking on the start file. A console window will appear and close after a while. Just wait until its gone. Now check the server's folder. You will find a bunch of new folders and files that have been generated. You need to accept the EULA (Minecrafts End-User-License-Agreement)to be able to run a Minecraft server. You will find a link in the eula.txt file. After you read it you need to set eula=false to eula=true . The start file now serves as the start button for the server.
